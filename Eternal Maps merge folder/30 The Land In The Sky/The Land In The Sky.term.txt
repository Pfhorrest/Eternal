Perhaps it knew. Knew that solitary existence was not existence at all. And so it succumbed and exploded, and with no other utterance,

                      $C1in an explosion of unimaginable light and heat$C3

                  $C1 atoms and molecules swarmed and collected in this$C3

        $C1 celestial crèche of material madness stars and bodies formed$C3

And within and around the toiling shapes, bonds were made that refused to give. First an atom, then two, then clusters and in such chaos they were bore, and were fast to adapt to their environments.

As the brothers to the stars they had within their very essence the power to bend matter and time and existence to their whims, yet infantile and without speech this power very nearly wielded them, and such as they were

Light overtaking darkness overtaking light as planets split apart in unnatural directions, molten cores evaporating and spinning away as a star implodes and explodes simultaneously; bodies and moons appear and disappear randomly, as solid objects pass through them as if they weren't truly there, in fact, they are not, nothing is truly there yet everything is there omnipresent, each piece, planet, comet, ship, and molecule is simultaneously dematerializing and solidifying, flowing free into confinement lasting milliseconds and infinities, time, gravity, mass, energy are amplified and diluted,$C1 they are coming$C3
