Yet you were different, whence God bore destiny on the eighth day so came you, though so many enter this plane kicking and screaming you suffered the weight to contain the burden of a birth so monumental, hiding it beneath the soft lines of your face, only now so human.$C1 $C3



$C0Here. Do not fret; a plaything.  I have not forgotten your affinity for such devices. Do you remember the burning sands, far away from here, and far away from now? The sand so red as a sea of embers, a dead place, a citadel, the top from which you avenged the fathers of your newfound friends, the flowing beings that spoke without words and thought through technology, reuniting them with kin believed dead but hoped alive?
