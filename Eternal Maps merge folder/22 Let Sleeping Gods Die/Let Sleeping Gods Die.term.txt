$C5                                 the wings of technology cannot reach
                 the hallowed grounds which you now seek


          before the clans were sundered
       the Master instructed us     S'bhuth
            the youngest Royalty of the S'pht
              of those now called S'pht'Kr

                to await the arrival of his Message
                       delivered by the Messenger

             young we were then
                         we did not understand
               the purpose of this prophecy

                              nor knew we the methods of its function

  but clues were left by the Master
    in the words of his many teachings

        long we have sought this place
for the powers which it holds

     and only so few orbits ago
   its purpose has been understood

but so deadly are the devices
                  of its activation
   that no S'pht may survive

      the [?rusty] F'lick'ta
         strong but thoughtless
   traverse its passages with ease
         and yet entirely without purpose
#INFORMATION
$C5    but you are the Messenger of Yrro
           for what other purpose sent?

 we understand the Message as it was prophesied
         and the Message is our salvation

 now in time of greatest need
     you are to be savior of our kind


       another world awaits all those who seek a life of peace


     the third sister of Lh'owon
                   high above this land
                             will see to her kin well



                         upon K'lia we find freedom from the fires
#PICT 1222 RIGHT

               find you this key
and seek out the lock
         hidden behind the curtains of fire


     our mind it conveys

              the key you now seek

                     and placed in the lock
              we shall open the door



        the path of ascension awaits

$C5In this chasm, aeons ago, died a demon W'rkncacnter. Long it slumbered, hidden beneath the barren sands of Lh'owon. Now at last he has awakened, and he has slain Pthia - my other, my sister, and my lover. This edifice I have erected to extract and entomb the demon, burying him again within the fires of our star.

You shall build, upon these grounds, a Citadel to commemorate the legacy of your kind and mine. It shall be a symbol of strength and unity to your people, when all other hope has failed. Come forth now, and hear your names:

S'pht'Lhar, S'pht'Hra, S'pht'Nma, S'pht'Kah, S'pht'Vir, S'pht'Yra, S'pht'Val, S'pht'Shr, S'pht'Mnr, S'pht'Yor, S'pht'Kr.

You eleven Olders I have gathered unto me. Though each of you heralds from one corner of Lh'owon, you alone amongst your kind may swim her entire breadth, upon the seas of the aether, beyond that realm of material beings to which your kin are bound.

In this aspect, you alone are most akin to my own kind. You shall lead eleven clans as sacred rulers of your kin. This world now holds no love for me, and soon I shall depart it. In another realm, my brethren await me.

I Yrro, who was your master, have failed to preserve you. Take your royalty to guide you, and live upon the paradise that you built for me. Unto you I leave only this one advice. Heed you this last prophecy: Do not mistake your rank and number for superiority. The oldest child may yet learn from the youngest.

Surely Mnr realise that Lhar hold the S'ct'lac'tr?

They may think us too squeamish to turn such a weapon on fellow S'pht, but if they continue to raid the civillian hamlets we may have no choice.

The fainthearted Kr will never forgive us for even considering this course of action, but their forgiveness will do us little good if Kr is slaughtered by Mnr.

Mnr drove us from our marsh at the fullness of T'jia.  Then Lhar came, claiming to liberate it for us, but this liberation came at a price too terrible to bear.

I never imagined we would think to look for safety by hiding here amongst the F'lick'ta.
