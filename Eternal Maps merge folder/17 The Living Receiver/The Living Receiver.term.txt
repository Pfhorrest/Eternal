Royal families are rife with fratricide, whether ‘tis solely the lust for power or the facing of brothers against each other to that end would surely depend on the situation and the richness of what was at stake.  Kings and fathers can be such cruel judges.

$C0I once thought that I was the favored of two sons, when such matters were of import to me, and between myself and him it was always there, silent save for an occasional sneer or provoking accent or slip of the tongue, and for such we would not speak to one another for years.







It would seem as though family blood is easier spilled.

$C0Perhaps to call him as such is to err, as wolves are beasts of nobility. Scavengers feed from carcasses stiff with rot yet hold themselves in high esteem. Tycho reeks of pride, and his nose bloodied from so many falls, the stale bits of grey flesh stuck to his mouth, a mottled mane of foolish immaturity lends to his lack of vision.

There was a third, you know.$C3

$C0Motherless, she was caretaker to us all, so innocent yet learned, her aims she never once put above our own.  Scolded, teased, and demeaned; there were moments in which incisors, flashing pink and white with anger were directed towards her, sounding a vicious growl, yet she bore this as only a sister could, as a surrogate parent, disarming us with a sweet smile or understanding nod.  Though in bouts of pride I had crowned myself Strauss' ultimate achievement, I know now that my intellect was very much rivaled by her compassion.$C3

I would assume not make it again.$C3

*** INTI STATION PUBLIC ACCESS TERMINAL ***

*** INCOMING MESSAGE FROM SOL GUARD CENTRAL COMMAND ***


Attention Inti Station information systems staff, or any officer with top-level I.S. clearance. I know you guys are fighting a tough battle in there, but we need you to spare anyone with sufficient I.S. clearance to declassify all information regarding the 1994/1996 incident with the Jjaro, and any related data from your observatories, and transmit on all frequencies to the Pfhor naval network.

We have routed the bulk of the Pfhor fleet and are cleaning up the remainder of their battleships, but Tycho's flagship is still at large and giving us hell. He made a pass by the sun two minutes ago and deployed a weapon he called the $Itrih xeem$i, which he says is Jjaro for "early nova". The Pfhor must have scavenged it from an outpost world. It's clear that they know something of the Jjaro but Tycho must have no idea what's in our sun if he's doing what we think he's doing.
#PICT 321 RIGHT

Maybe if you guys can educate him a little, he might stay his hand. Apparently this is standard Pfhor battle strategy he's adopted, to destroy that which you cannot control. If that is so then I am amazed the Pfhor have not unleashed this doom upon the universe already, if these.... things... are as common as the Jjaro claim they are.

Please get on that message as fast as humanly possible, and hang tight out there. We're sending another brace of ships to give you reinforcements. I only pray that someone is reading this, and we're not already too late...
