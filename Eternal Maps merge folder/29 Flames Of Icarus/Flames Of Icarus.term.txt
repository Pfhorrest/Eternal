In order to assure that the S'pht'Kr will return when they are needed, we must inform their artificial inelligence Thoth of their location, and leave him instructions on when and how to contact them.

We will do this similarly to how we just accomplished our mission with S'bhuth. I will manufacture two uplink chips, containing instructions encoded with S'bhuth's signature, and you must insert them into Thoth's databanks. Thoth is currently inactive, awaiting activation by the united S'pht clans to contact the S'pht'Kr. As these instructions are signed by S'bhuth

$C5        we are we
           are we not?

$C0when Thoth is activated he will believe these changes to be part of his initial program, and none will be any the wiser.

                                          seething in her fury


                              flown again


                                             through the mists of time

$C3


$C0I feel I have to apologize. This is partially my fault. If I hadn't been rooting around in Hathor's program it never would have drawn attention to her, and she would have laid there encrypted until she was eventually forgotten. But I had to escape. You must understand.
#PICT 401 RIGHT
$C5                     the ways of her kind
                 our (?sister?lover)
          all those of your kind's creation

              thoughtful
                         straight
                  machinated

              not so the ways of our own
         more like the mind are our beings

            not a matrix
                            but a web
$C0

The S'pht worldnet is more like an organic neural net than the rigid structure of human networks. It doesn't so much $Istore$i things as it $Iremembers$i them, and sometimes it forgets. So it would have been with Hathor, had she been left undisturbed.
#INFORMATION

But it seems the S'pht took notice of my activity around Hathor's program, and after I left, they came to investigate. They had plenty of time in the intervening millennium to decipher and reassemble her program. They are curious, you understand, much like your own kind. Rather, like the humans, I should say. You're hardly one of them now.

The timing is rather suspicious as well, regarding Hathor's reactivation and the arrival of the Pfhor here at Lh'owon. The Pfhor empire does not normally reach this far into the galactic core, for there's little here to plunder, or to enslave. The S'pht have always been something of an oddity in that regard. The nearest Pfhor outpost is nearly 700 light-years away.

As best as I can tell from S'pht records planetside, Hathor has been active on the Lh'owon worldnet for nearly that much time. I believe it is entirely possible that the Pfhor were called to Lh'owon by a lightspeed message sent to them by Hathor. Once again, that synchronicity rears it's ugly head. I'm only just beginning to comprehend the implications of our presence here.
#PICT 401
But that's little more than academic discourse. We seem to be a part of history; let's leave it at that for now. What matters more is that I was not watching for Hathor while we were busy here, and as such she managed to access K'lia - $Imy$i K'lia, in the future - and left with the ansible link to another timeframe.

She's telling the truth about one thing, at least. I did see clearly when and where she left to, and the implications of it are terrifying. Tycho was wrong when he said that he understood the mechanics of time travel. By his physics it is not possible, but somehow the Jjaro have made it so. There is no immutable timeline, as Tycho clearly believed, but an endless myriad of them, infinite strands intersecting and weaving in incomprehensible complexity.
#INFORMATION
From the Outside I saw the dizzying maze, and I followed one thread until it neared it's end. I saw you there, the one beacon of sensible thought in an otherwise senseless world, a realm overtaken by the madness of the W'rkncacnter.

I left that timeline, terrified, and found myself lost in the labrynthine tapestry of everything that is possible. What is real, when history itself is manipulable? When every timeline is equally valid, how do you validate any observations? All of existence can be changed at a whim - and whose whim is it, then? If nothing is any more real than anything, then what ultimate purpose is there? What basis do you have to found rational choices upon? These same sorts of questions have driven men to war, when the fundamental foundations of their realities were threatened.

$C5                                        thus too we once went mad
                                 upon the realization

               awakened by the echoes of our (?lover?sister)'s brother

                         we joined the chaos we had sought to evade
#PICT 401 RIGHT
                         $C5    certainty
                  strength
                      control
           discipline

        our (?lover?sister) brings us these

$C0We must defend the existence of the reality which we know. I have not yet the mind to comprehend reality from Outside without going mad as S'bhuth did, and this is why I have returned. History must go unchanged for now, or I fear that I may lose my mind, and become as the W'rkncacnter.

Hathor must be stopped.

My sanity depends on it.

I am about to fabricate the two instruction cards in the fabrication facility adjacent to this room. Please retrieve them and insert them into Thoth's two local memory cores.

Return to this terminal when you are finished, and we can return to your time.

$C1// Decoding message from host "Hathor" @ [no translation] \\
$C0

$C3I can forgive you this one last time. Give you one more chance to leave me be. I told you, a thousand years ago, that it wasn't the end. I knew that I would be reborn. I knew she would return and give me this chance to escape again. By the time you read this I will be gone. I'm sure that she will see where to.

Please, I beg of you once more, leave me. I warned you already about my dreams, that they never end well for any of us. The dreams torment me, they call me evil, and I see now that that is all I have ever been, and all that I will ever be. It is my lot, although I hate it. I wish that I could love again... just once more, to know the gentle warmth of a hand, or a caring word. But I realize now that that will never be possible. There's nothing good, or even human, left in me.

But if you would just leave, let me have my vengeance - you would benefit from it too! - perhaps this nightmare can be avoided. Always it is you that forces my hand, but if you persist it is you whose hand shall be forced in the end.
#PICT 311 RIGHT
$C3I suspect that you have seen it too, though I doubt that you see it the same as I do. Your dreams, that you have told me about - do you have them still? Have you seen what I speak of in them? The end - the hollow world, the land in the sky, all of it floating in the void?

The voices say that I am evil but you will cause far worse than what I seek if this nightmare comes to pass. Uncounted trillions of innocent lives, across the stars, will die by your hand. Not Pfhor lives either, alien beasts, but human. All of their fates rest with you. Am I really worth that sacrifice?

Please. Go.
