Welcome, Messenger. Your task was well executed. The slavers have been drawn far off from our true plot, and all but one beacon has been lit in the riddle of the S'pht'Kr.

Please, continue, while we seek the final lights that will recall S'pht'Kr to our salvation.

the quiet sleep at last is broken

                        time seems far gone
            and yet not enough


         lost kin
                       the elder youth


             far flung by machinations
                     untouched
                           by the firstborn

    soon to win this battle
                      in a time far too new


             witness now the consequences
                       of your intervention
