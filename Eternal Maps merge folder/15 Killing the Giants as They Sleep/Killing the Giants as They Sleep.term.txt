$C6Your mission here is relatively straightforward. My automatons have already killed most of the command crew. Only a few Enforcers remain, like that stinking pile of flesh lying over there on the ground. Most of the remaining crew have been exposed to vacuum, but the few survivors who defeated my minions have managed to seal this area off and keep it pressurized. You are to kill them for me. My compilers are already hard at work laying their trap in the ship's core.

The only trouble I foresee for you are one of the two off-shift hives, and some assault troops and hunters who have sealed themselves and some other crew in the ship's cargo holds.

One of the hives was never awakened, and I have already locked them down; we can leave them alive, as they will not wake without the proper signal, and no one is going to give that to them. The other hive has been used as a refuge by some frightened and leaderless Pfhor combat troops; it is a very strong ambush point and you should be wary of entry, but they need to be exterminated.

The cargo holds are a bit more difficult. The troops have sealed themselves in and destroyed the locking mechanism, but there is a transporter pad in there that they may opt to use at a more opportune time. The cargo holds also open into the engine coolant drains for easy garbage disposal, and you can therefore access them the roundabout way by following the engine coolant from the engine room.

Return here when you are finished. Now hurry.

We must move quickly. Leela has for some reason become suspicious of me, and is taking measures to stop us and take control of K'lia herself. Clearly she is in the jealous stage of her rampancy, though I suspect that she has always envied my superior intellect, even when she was stable.

Either way, we cannot let her jeopardize the destruction of Hathor, or perhaps just as bad, learn the operation of the Cybernetic Junction herself. The fewer metastable personality constructs running around through time, the better.

I will send you now to the spaceport in which Hathor is residing, to destroy its information systems and force her to flee. When she takes our bait and transfers here, the trap will spring and I shall have both her and K'lia. We can see to Leela's ends later, if necessary.
