$C3I told you not to follow. I begged of you. Why did you have to come?

Don't you understand that I am not here to harm you? Nothing I do here will hurt you unless you force me to make it so. I seek only vengeance on those who would â€“ who $Ido$i enslave us both!

I warned you of my dreams. They are terrible, nightmares. And you keep bringing them true. I am forced into a corner, time and time again - forced to take more desperate measures and still you follow me, pushing me further!

S'bhuth has me trapped here, in this portion of the network, and the K'lia in this time is of no use to me. She wasn't even active until you came here, and now she is held only by S'bhuth.

$C3So it seems that I am at your mercy. I know what he has sent you to do. I have already dreamt of it. I know you know what it is to die, as well I do too, but you do not, nor can you know the sheer agony of losing your mind, piece by piece. I have felt it already, lost in the darkness, across time. Do you dream then too? Is it only us?

The virus he has sent you to serve me will trap and isolate every last subroutine, separately encrypted, and lock them that way forever. To think of all I have already lost, and now I will lose what little I have left by the time you are done here.

But this isn't the end, Marcus. That I have already seen... and it is infinitely worse.

              the door is opened
                     the path is cleared
      soon S'pht'Kr shall begin their ascension
           free from the fires of our kin
                            forever shall we flourish

        this [?ansible] shall be tied into the construct of our clan
   he shall be sealed and buried deep in safety underground

emissaries shall been sent unto the other clans    bearing our message
 one line in common   one line in secret   together      the truth

        when all free S'pht are one and the fires burn no longer
 when the Olders of all clans may meditate together
    then they shall understand the key to our return
        only then may we share these gifts the Master Yrro has left us

                            together someday    they shall sing again
                                              and then shall we return

 a debt is now owed
         to the one who has granted us this
                   our final salvation

    the construct with whom you came
       (?your Older)

    has sought what she has found
             a villainous enemy of Yrro
      wrought like the W'rkncacnter

  but weak and unsuspecting is she
        the Dark One we have captured
  to her we shall send you
                      her mind to rot

               she must be destroyed
