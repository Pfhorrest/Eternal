The transporter grid has been damaged in this sector due to [?enemy] attacks, so I cannot transport you directly to a node within the [?guardian]'s network. Therefore you must enter the [?guardian]'s complex on foot. Speak with [?him?it] and request the defense codes on an [?artifact] so that I may assume [?his?its] functions.

Return here when you have the codes and I will aid you further.

Excellent. You have retrieved the command codes on an [?artifact], as I recommended. I will now transport you near to my own datacore, so that you may connect the artifact to my internal network.

Please stand by for departure. Initiating...

welcome, [?master]. i am the [?guardian] of this installation. my apologies for the brevity of this message; my [?mind?program] is severely damaged and failing by the minute. this node is the only remaining functional portion of my core facility.

i have [?fabricated] a systems interface artifact for you at a location near the periphery of my facility, where some systems are still functional. on it you will find a copy of the installation's defense codes.

you may bring the artifact to the [?watcher]. [?he?it] may be able to make use of the codes to assume some of my [?functions?duties].

i cannot aid you further. farewell.
