No, I already have access to this clan's network. I need you to access another terminal so I can pinpoint where we are in time and see if there's any sign of Hathor that I'm not seeing from here.

However, I do have access to the teleporter grid from here. I think I can put you near a pattern buffer closer to another clan's network. Hang on...

Well, I can't find any clear data transfer records that would let me trace Hathor's arrival and movement in the network. The S'pht worldnet seems to function more like a giant neural net, retaining and discarding data in a very nonlinear, unstructured fashion.

You should stay here inside the Citadel. I will transport you further into the upper levels. Try not to be seen, and disturb as little as possible. Log in to as many terminals as you can find, so we can access further information.

   $C5when came the W'rkncacnter

           Yrro became an angry master

    we have no word in our tongue
                        by which to call
       the Messenger of Yrro

   sent unto us now in our time of need


      peacefull are the young S'pht'Kr
 mindful of our ways
    intending no harm to our elder brethren

     their Olders battle for selfish needs
                    with no consideration
        for the kinship of our people

  long has S'pht'Kr struggled
         to bring peace to all our kin
 but failure has come to us at last

$C5  weapons built for our defense
          now are turned against the S'pht
                             in hatred and in greed
              wielded by brother against his kin

though S'pht'Kr cannot bear to witness nor to partake of this carnage
       the S'pht'Mnr attack us at our very heart
           our villages are slaughtered     our Defenders overrun
    and the last of our people entomed within their chambers

  yet there is known a way to flee
                 a path of ascension awaits S'pht'Kr
         prophecized long ago           by the father Yrro

     we have awaited only the arrival of his Messenger

                                        seek you the pathway far below
                                            and deliver our salvation

Welcome to Lh'owon. At least, that's what Blake told me when I showed him the coordinates from Hathor's last transport. Does it look familiar to you? It's probably changed a lot between now and the last time that you saw it... we've arrived here some 2000 years earlier.

Give me a moment to see if I can connect to the S'pht network...

There we are. This place is even roomier than you are, though I suppose that's to be expected for a planetary grid. It still doesn't hold a candle to the Vylae network.

Let me see if I can find any useful information around here. My trace of Hathor was approximate - it seems the process of aiming an ansible link is done fractally, refining the resolution in diminishing increments, and I didn't catch the last few cycles of it. We may be on the wrong continent, or have missed her by a few years. I'm sure you noticed our entrance here was anything but stable. Lucky we wound up as low in the atmosphere as we did.

Here we go. This is Lh'owon, just as Blake said, and this building is called the 'Citadel of Antiquities' - stop me if I'm covering data that you already know.
#PICT 361

I see no immediate sign of Hathor, which could mean we have arrived before her, but we should look a bit into public history here to see if there are any signs of her arriving earlier.

Roomy as the worldnet is, the S'pht are fragmented into eleven separate clans at this point in history, and I can only access one clan's information from this terminal.

I need you to access another terminal so I can pinpoint where we are in time and see if there's any sign of Hathor that I'm not seeing from here.

No, I already have access to this clan's network. You can find more terminals in the tower to the south of the compound. You know that tall, round building we saw earlier while we were falling?  That tower.

I'm sure you can find your way there.

Fires burn, and the marshes of the western hamlets are turning to ash, scorching black the water.

Here we are. This terminal's clan has access to a meticulous record of historical events, including astronomical data, that I can use to pinpoint where we are in history.
And now that I have a second clan's access, I should be able to hack in to more of the network and start looking for any sign of Hathor.

According to the records here, you should be able to find more terminals in the nearby tower. Head there while I search the S'pht worldnet.

Older foretold that ere the clans are united, ours would be destroyed. As battle rages across the marshes, as innocent S'pht die in the crossfire, we $C1[?dread?anticipate]$C5 the possible imminence of our demise.

Yet the windows of this citadel have not been closed, as Older foretold, nor will they be. The marshes are far from here, and the Citadel remains a place where all S'pht congregate, despite the minor skirmishes when Mnr and Lhar meet.
#PICT 382


$C5If this is not the end, how much more bloodshed must the Hra witness?  We would join the Kr in turning away, but they will not have us, lest their appendages be the ones that fulfill Older's prophecy.

I believe that Hathor came here to destroy the S'pht, or somehow help them destroy themselves, here in the distant past, so as to deprive mankind of their aid in the wars that are to come. As tempted as I'm sure you must be to go out and start killing $Isomething$i to fix the problem, we must be careful not to act rashly here lest we disturb this timeline even further.

Keep logging into terminals, I need more information.

$BReport to Leader$b
$IAnomalous beings detected$i

A most unusual biped just was seen crawling out of the lava ponds. It appeared to be bonded to cybernetics and thus sentient, but not like anything we have seen before. Nearby Mnr and Lhar both fired on it immediately, so it may be an ally of Kr.

Moments later, an unusual presence was detected on our computer net, and just as soon vanished. Like the biped, what little we could ascertain bore no resemblance to any entity we know. We have forwarded this intelligence to S'bhuth, hopefully they will have some answers.

That is not good news. It would appear that S'pht computer security is much more capable than I anticipated. We $Bmust$b be more careful to hide our presence here. On the other hand, their failure to recognise us suggests that particular clan has not had contact with Hathor.

Now that I have enough access, I am going to initiate a planetwide search for Hathor to be positive that she has not yet arrived. If we are extremely fortunate we will have arrived here earlier than her, and thus when she arrives here we should have the element of surprise.

Please be patient, this may take a while.
