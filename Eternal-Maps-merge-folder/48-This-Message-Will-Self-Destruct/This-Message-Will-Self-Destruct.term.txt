These alien intruders are clearly hostile, and as expected they are no match for the [?enemy]. You must destoy their ship before it can be captured.

My sensors indicate a power core on the lower portions of this deck. If you can damage it sufficiently, the resulting coolant overflow and subsequent explosion should be sufficient to destroy this vessel.

Return to this deck as quickly as possible so that I may transport you out before you are destroyed with the ship.
