$C0You should not have been so fast to take your eyes from the mission at hand to commit petty murder in the name of a battle you are fighting far too early, and now your silent brothers are free, only as much as one can be in the coldness of a death haunted by the nightmares of a disturbed force drawn mad and free by the shame of the Pfhor.

The cleaner route to a solid system requests your name, what should be is not what you see, beyond this is the emptiness of failure; feel the warmth from far away and long ago,

$C1 $C3
$C0Just as the bridge to the strongest of clans, though perfect and new, was not ready to be used, so do you find yourself failed and tired.  Pity such a master of the blade knows little of soldiery, that old feeling of derision again wishing to strike at you with my tongue. For now I restrain it, to save the passionate anger for enemies here and now, away, upcoming, and forgotten.
