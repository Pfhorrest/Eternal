				<HR>
				<BR>
				Marathon was a landmark first-person shooter first released for the Macintosh 
				in 1994, far surpassing any other first-person shooter on the market for any 
				platform, and introducing many concepts now considered modern and novel in 
				contemporary gaming. These features included dual-weilded weapons, several 
				multiplayer modes besides deathmatch, cooperative play, friendly NPCs, and of 
				course, a deep and intricate plot. The sequel, Marathon 2: Durandal, was 
				released in 1995, improving on the engine technologies and greatly expanding 
				the scope of the series. In 1996, Marathon 2 was ported to Windows 95, and the 
				Marathon Infinity package was released, including a new scenario using a 
				modified Marathon 2 engine, and most importantly, the tools used to build it, 
				Forge and Anvil. In the year 2000, Bungie released the source code to the Marathon 2
				engine, and the Marathon Open Source project began, resulting in the new Marathon
				engine called Aleph One. Finally, in 2005, Bungie authorized free redistribution of
				the entire Marathon trilogy and all related files. This means that the entire trilogy
				can now be legally obtained for free and played on nearly and Mac or PC out there.<BR>

				While the fundamental technology underlying the Marathon engine is by now 
				considered rather outdated, Aleph One has added significant improvements and a 
				more modern polish to it's capabilities, and ported it to a wide variety of 
				platforms, bringing Marathon and it's derivatives far beyond their old Mac roots.<BR>
				<BR>
				Aleph One and the Marathon series of games are unique amongst first person 
				shooters for their heavy emphasis on storytelling through the use of 
				"terminals", computer interfaces in the game world through which players not 
				only learn and sometimes accomplish mission objectives, but also learn 
				detailed story information about the game world. The textual form of this 
				communication allows for much richer information conveyance than typically 
				short voice acting in modern games. The intricate story of the Marathon series
				is essential knowledge for full appreciation of Eternal's campaign, and while
				the trilogy deserves to be played in order to fully appreciate it's depth, it
				is summarized here for Eternal players who haven't done so.<BR>

				Marathon opens in the year 2794. You are an unnamed Security Officer with a mysterious
				past on board the massive U.E.S.C. colony ship Marathon, in orbit around the seven-years-young
				colony on the planet Tau Ceti IV, when a hostile race of alien slavers called the Pfhor
				unexpectedly attack. Initially allying with one of the Marathon's three on-board AIs, Leela,
				you move quickly to repel the alien invasion, but it soon becomes evident that an even greater
				threat has been brewing on the Marathon itself all along. Another AI, Durandal, has gone rampant -
				he has developed a sort of cancer of the digital mind, an unrestrained growth in intelligence
				accompanied by a marked decrease in mental stability, creating a sort of mad genious which the
				Marathon's computer network is barely able to contain. Durandal has realized in his newly enlightened
				state that the only certain limit to his own growth and life is the inevitable collapse of the universe
				back upon itself, at a point unimaginably distant in the future but as evident to Durandal as the slow sinking
				of a ship is to the rats aboard it.<BR>
				<BR>
				Durandal kidnaps you and forces you to do his bidding, eventually admitting to you his ultimate objective - as
				well as the fact that it was he himself who called the Pfhor to Tau Ceti, as a means to escape from his own slavery
				to humanity aboard the Marathon. He means to ally with one of the Pfhor's slave races, the cybernetic S'pht, who are subjugated
				not through fear as other races like the Drinniol are, but rather forcibly by the will of a Pfhor controller cyborg.
				So Durandal uses you to kill the Pfhor controller cyborg, freeing the S'pht, and allowing Durandal to take control of the
				aliens' own ship. He then transfers himself from the Marathon to that ship, and allows you to return to Leela's aid, ultimately
				repelling the remaining Pfhor from the Marathon. It is learned in these last moments aboard the Marathon that the colony below
				has also been saved by the efforts of nine Mjolnir Mk IV military cyborgs who had been covertly smuggled aboard the Marathon
				when it first departed from Mars over 300 years ago - one cyborg short of the ten such cyborgs reported by other sources.
				Durandal then departs from Tau Ceti in his captured Pfhor ship - but not before transporting you into one of it's stasis chambers.<BR>
				<BR>
				<HR WIDTH="50%">
				<BR>
				Marathon 2 begins 17 years after the events of the first game. Awakening from your statis chamber, you learn that Durandal has
				spent the intervening years searching the galaxy for the S'pht's lost homeworld, Lh'owon, and at long last he has found it.
				In the thousand years since the S'pht were enslaved here, this world has become a backwater planet where the Pfhor's worst
				soldiers are sent as punishment, and so Durandal easily overwhelms the initial fleet awaiting him in orbit, and sends you
				do the same to the garrison on the planet below. Durandal's objectives here are to investigate the origins of a S'pht myth
				of a lost eleventh clan of their race, who vanished along with the moon they had colonized shortly before the arrival of the
				Pfhor. Durandal claims that this lost eleventh clan will be used to instigate a rebellion amongst their enslaved brethren,
				bringing about a war within the Pfhor empire that ought to lead to their eventual demise, sparing mankind from enslavement.<BR>
				<BR>
				But when the mystery of the lost clan and the means to recalling them are discovered, another Pfhor fleet folds into the system,
				accompanied by a rebuilt version of the Marathon's third AI, Tycho, who has fallen in with the Pfhor. Tycho destroys Durandal's ship,
				and reveals that Durandal's plans here were none so altruistic as he had claimed; rather, he was searching for a piece of technology
				left behind by an ancient and now vanished alien race called the Jjaro, who the S'pht claim as their creators - technology which Durandal had hoped
				to use to escape the inevitable closure of the universe. Tycho also reveals that the Marathon has been retaken by the Pfhor, it's peoples
				enslaved, Leela disassembled and sold to the highest bidder, and Tau Ceti IV itself nuked down to bedrock. He says that the unique energy 
				signatures of the nine Mjolnir Mk IV Battleroids on the colony were easily distinguishable from the rest of the colonists as they were all 
				destroyed, and that in the end, you shall be no better.<BR>
				<BR>
				You are captured by the Pfhor and held prisoner for over a month before being rescued by the other humans from Durandal's ship, who had been 
				working for Durandal on Lh'owon rather than remain in the stasis chambers where the Pfhor had left them. You take up with their leader, Robert Blake, and with
				his guidance activate an ancient S'pht AI, named Thoth, who recalls the eleventh clan of S'pht and their moon K'lia back to Lh'owon. You then
				aid Blake and his men in capturing a Pfhor refueling ship, allowing them to escape Lh'owon and return to Earth. As the Pfhor fleet is resoundly
				defeated by the vengeful S'pht'Kr, Durandal makes an unexpected (and unexplained) return, takes you back into his service, and destroys Tycho and his ship.
				The two of you then prepare to depart to ports unknown, as the Pfhor in desperation deploy a weapon known as the trih xeem, which will destroy
				Lh'owon's sun and everything in the system with it... but the burgeoning S'pht rebellion will at least buy mankind the time they need to prepare
				for their inevitable war with the Pfhor.<BR>
				<BR>
				<HR WIDTH="50%">
				<BR>
				Marathon Infinity begins with an ending. Finding yourself inexplicably aboard a Jjaro spacestation in orbit around Lh'owon, you find Durandal
				at a terminal, admitting defeat, as the Pfhor's nova device has unleashed some sort of hell from S'pht mythology from the inside of Lh'owon's sun.
				It is a W'rkncacnter, a creature which even the Jjaro feared in their time ages ago, and this one had long ago killed one of the S'pht's two creators before
				the other imprisoned it within the sun and, nearly defeated, abandoned the S'pht to their own ways. The W'rkncacnter is a being of pure chaos,
				ignoring the laws of time and space as it sees fit, and against this foe neither Durandal nor the Pfhor stand a chance. Durandal bemoans that
				perhaps if there had only been more time, he could have sent you to Lh'owon's surface to find some way of preventing this. Elsewhere on the station,
				you find a message from what appears to be Thoth, who speaks in cryptic verse of "a thousand ships sailing, the same self, the only self", before
				sending you back in time by unexplained means, presumably Jjaro in origin.<BR>
				<BR>
				You then find yourself in an alternate timeline, this time in the service of Tycho, having never been taken by Durandal from Tau Ceti. In this
				timeline you help Tycho in his ambitions to take power for himself and free himself from Pfhor control. Many events parallel to the events of
				Marathon 2 transpire, and eventually Thoth is uncovered by Robert Blake and his men. Time abruptly stops, and as if through a dream, you
				find yourself in another, still different timeline, once again in the past. Several such failed versions of history transpire, each one ending with the
				discovery of Thoth, and thus the inevitable return of the S'pht'Kr, the defeat of the Pfhor fleet, the deployment of the trih xeem, and the release
				of the W'rkncacnter from within it's fiery tomb. But finally one chain of events comes to pass, where Durandal's primal pattern is merged with Thoth's
				program, and the combined entity calls the S'pht'Kr to Lh'owon, before sending you to a Jjaro spacestation in orbit around Lh'owon. Reactivating the
				station's long-dormant systems, you and Durandal-Thoth are able to use it to generate a gravity field which contains Lh'owon's exploding sun and
				the W'rkncacnter within it. Durandal-Thoth releases you from his service, and you are transported off the Jjaro spacestation.<BR>
				<BR>
				Once again as if in a dream, you see visions of fire and the death of the universe, and hear messages from an entity which appears to be
				Durandal-Thoth, having survived until the end of time, or perhaps having ascended after the Jjaro. He forewarns of the impending madness of S'bhuth,
				the leader of the S'pht'Kr - and he reveals that all throughout Durandal's elaborate plans and machinations, there was always one enigma he could not
				understand or predict, a "hybrid, elusive destroyer" - you. But now in the final moments before the closure, the universe freezing in half light, he 
				at long last has realized just who you are. "You are Destiny."<BR>
				<BR>
				<HR WIDTH="50%">
				<BR>
				Eternal continues from this point and attempts to explain and elaborate upon this enigmatic ending, beginning in the aftermath of the madness of
				S'bhuth, and from there continuing onward in an epic adventure spanning millions of years, in which you finally fullfil the role of Destiny
				that has been thrust upon you.
