In began, in concept, with a letter I wrote to Jason Jones				sometime between the release of Marathon 2 and the announcement of Marathon Infinity.				(A letter which I still have saved, I should mention, but will refrain from				releasing here because I sounded really stupid when I was 12). The letter was				a request for a sequel to end all sequels to Marathon - a sequel featuring time				travel, alternate timelines, and a colossal set of my childish misunderstandings of				astronomy, physics, and the finer intricacies of the Marathon storyline - along with				a request for the release of the editors. I have no idea if Jason ever got this				letter, as it was sent to the old address of his hidden in the Marathon 1 resource 				fork.<BR>				<BR>				One way or another, imagine my joy with the way Marathon Infinity turned out. I can 				say they certainly did a much better job than I could have, especially back then. 				(Not that I'm implying there is ANY connection, mind you...)<BR>				<BR>				Nevertheless, having my greatest Marathon dreams realized, I still felt compelled				with the release of the editors to create a project of my own. I began writing a				further sequel to Marathon, still very unrefined, and called the project "Forever				More: Beyond Infinity Lies Destiny". The plot was inspired loosely by the				discussions on the Marathon Story Page, and sought in essence to simply explain all				the loose ends in the Marathon universe. It consisted of nearly random jumps across				space and time to important events in the Marathon timeline, very poor if any				character development, no real objectives, and laughable dialogue, to say the best.				Nevertheless I did not at the time realize these flaws and continued to work on it,				gathering to me a small team, to finish what was then a simple map pack.<BR>				<BR>				<HR WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="center">				<BR>				The release of Marathon EVIL changed all of that, and I felt the ante of the				"average" scenario upped. I set out making plans for new textures, monsters,				weapons, etc... all before the initial map pack was even done. This continued for a 				long time, and eventually a lot of that content got made. Several other projects				were begun at that same time, most of them by the regulars of the "Bungie Boards" on				AOL, what was once a major hangout of Bungie fans (back when AOL sucked much less -				yeah, that long ago). Some of these other projects were:<BR>				<BR>				"Haydon: The Pfhor Underground", lead by someone named Dave who went by the				pseudonym "Cyclone", with a talented artist named Ken Hodgeman who once went by the				pseudonym "Fish Flare".<BR>				<BR>				"The Rameses Project", lead initially by Ben Wigler, and later by Svywranth (real				name withheld). Rameses featured some beautiful textures made by Thomas Zackaraias 				Westburg, now of Laboratoriet.com, which were made originally for a failed				commercial game project codenamed "Escape", also lead by Ben Wigler, on which I				also worked.<BR>				<BR>				"Chimera", which began as a short story written by Nick Nethery, who at my urging				built a scenario team around it, which later merged with Chris Lund and Dan				Rudolph's "Salinger" project, and under the direction of Scott Brown eventually				became Rubicon.<BR>				<BR>				Obviously, only one of these other projects ever saw the light of day, as Rubicon 				was released to great fanfare a few years ago. Haydon died and was assimilated, and 				Ken's beautiful weapons became my project's weapons. Rameses eventually fell into my 				hands too, and unable to run two scenarios into the ground at once, I turned it over 				to the Orphanage at Bungie.org.<BR>				<BR>				Since the days of mass assimilation, Forever More underwent semiannual				near-completions. The problem was always that we would get 90% done with the old 				plans, and then realize how much better it could be made now, or how horrible some 				of the old content looked in comparison to the new, or how some stuff didn't work				with the new stuff anymore. (I now agree wholeheartedly with Chris Lund on the topic 				of retexturing levels). Over the years certain people began to mock me and the 				project in general, under the mantra as "real artists ship". Because of them, the				project sank into the underground, lost any web presence besides a listing on				ScenarioNews, changed names, and assumed a disguise (namely that of 'rotting corpse').<BR>				<BR>				<HR WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="center">				<BR>				The project has been majorly revised and almost completely redesigned at least 3				times, besides the original rewrite from my first concept letter. First, I added a 				chapter on the Human-S'pht war with the Pfhor, and a chapter on the Pfhor conquest 				of Lh'owon. Then, the entire basis of the plot was changed to surround the concept of				"the Eternals", character roles shifted to better serve the new focus, terminals				entirely rewritten, the main non-player character Olifant's name was changed				to Laqet (and his sex changed to a her), and the entire project was renamed 				"Eternal". More recently, a team calling themselves Anomatica, who were assimilating				the remains of dead scenarios to build one of their own, attempted to assimilate 				Eternal, and wound up being assimilated themselves. That team has since dissolved 				and I am again alone with Eternal, but in the process of the reverse-takeover, much				of the plot was changed for the better, including the merger of chapters 1 and 2				(now 1), the merger of chapters 4 and 5 (now 3), and the dropping of chapter 7 				entirely, for a new chapter 5. Laqet was again renamed, to Hathor.<BR>				<BR>				Most of the work in these intermittent spurts of activity got done during winter and				summer breaks, and every time school season began again, most of the team would quit				and never come back. But out of all of this, new content kept getting generated.				Slowly but surely Eternal amassed a huge library of very useful parts, but always				incomplete as a whole. As I graduated high school in 2000 and joined the work force,				my available free time dropped drastically, and little if anything was done on Eternal				for a period of about four years. A tweak here, a new bit of art there. I did come up				with the basis of the latest batch of textures and did most of the work on them, but				that was about it.<BR>				<BR>				So on March 25th of 2004, I decided to call the project dead and release everything				that had been created for it, along with the plans for what it was to become, 				including what had up to that point been a closely guarded secret, the entire story				synopsis. But soon thereafter, a small flood of supporters insisted that I not drop				the project, and let them help me finish it. They have all since left and I am again				alone with the project, with temporary relief brought in from various sources to help				with one portion or another. But in all, I finally set out to release something				once and for all, to prove to myself and the world that all this time and effort				hasn't been for naught. And so there I was again, another summer, another year,				another "almost finished"... but would this time be any different?<BR>				<BR>				<HR WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="center">				<BR>				On June 18th, 2004, development on the Eternal Project officially began anew. I				decided to use an incremental release schedule, releasing one chapter at a time,				and improving on the earlier chapters with the subsequent releases. As such these				were not exactly "chapters", and yet they weren't really "betas" of the full project				either. Thus I coined a new release term, "Marks", in honor of the "Mark" versioning				nomenclature used for the Mjolnir cyborgs. With this "Mark" scheme, I could be				guaranteed that even if the final project was never completed, that at least				something would be released for all the work put into it.<BR>				<BR>				I set Mark I's tenative release date for July 25th - my 22nd birthday, and the 				pre-anniversary of the attack on the Marathon. The UESC Marathon was (or will be?) 				attacked by the Pfhor at 8:20 AM, July 25th, 2794, and thus my birthday and 				Mark I's release date would fall exactly 790 years before that date. With a lot of				hard work and the help of many people who have since lost their enthusiasm for the				project, Eternal Mk I was released, feature complete and just as planned,				8:20 AM (Eastern) on July 25th, 2004 - precisely on schedule.<BR>				<BR>				For Mark II, even less work was needed, so I figured that in the same five-week				time frame we could easily complete the work needed to get Mark II out the door.				Thus I set it's release date for August 31st, 2004. Unfortunately, by this time				many people had begun to lose interest in the project, and beset with some personal				traumas myself, work dragged along much more slowly than it had for Mk I.				Nevertheless, the project was missing only two levels by release time, better than				my early expectations. Because of this incompleteness, and the unexpected level of				criticism for the first release, Mark II was released much more quietly.<BR>				<BR>				Surprisingly, the feedback for Mark II was overwhelmingly positive, and this spurred				me on to work hard on getting Mark III out the door as well, and in just as high				quality. Thankfully much of the work for Mark III involved revising materials made				in earlier incarnations of the project. With the help of a few other people, the				few levels that were not revisions were created, as well as the two missing levels				from chapter 2, and Eternal Mark III was released feature-complete, on schedule,				five weeks after Mark II's release on October 7th, 2004.<BR>				<BR>				I had realized when setting Eternal Mk II's release date that, entirely coincidentally,				following a five-week (or rather, month and a week) release schedule for each Mark would				lead to Eternal Mark V, the penultimate version, being released on Marathon's 10th				anniversary. It seemed only fitting, and chance had it that development should begin				five weeks before my birthday, setting the schedule as it was. But sticking so tightly				to this schedule caused problems with Eternal Mk IV. While all of the maps for it got				finished in time for the Nov 14th release, other important features - such as the monster				which is the chapter's namesake - did not get completed in time, and this version was				extremely buggy and undertested due to continuing problems in my personal life.				Disappointed with my own work, and with those few vocal fans who had kept me going				occupied with other parts of their lives - and the predevelopment on Mark V not looking				promising at all - I considered making this Mark IV the final version of Eternal, the				project that's never really completely done and yet never manages to die, either.<BR>				<BR>				But enough people wrote in with their enthusiastic pleas that I decided to continue and				and the very least try to make Mark V. If it wasn't at least as close as Mark II or IV				to "done" by release, I would scrap it and leave Eternal endless, unless Eternal X was				ever made. But low and behold, despite missing the new sprites needed for the enemies in				chapter 5, and almost nobody else helping with this chapter at all, Eternal Mk V was				pushed toward release by some long, sleepless nights on my part, and a lot of help from				Don-Martin Antell. Like Mark II, all but two levels were finished; and like Mark IV, the				new monster sprites were missing; but I considered that close enough to my set goal, and				so at midnight on December 21st, 2004, after 26 (and some fraction) long weeks of work,				the Eternal saga was, at least in some sense of the word, "done".<BR>				<BR>				<HR WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="center">				<BR>				Development after the release of Mark V was supposed to be brief: the whole project would				be gone over with a fine-toothed comb, all bugs squashed, all ugliness polished, all				irritants soothed, so that the whole project would be a solid, beautiful, fun thing to				play, rather than the incomplete rush job that Mark V was. To that end, I recruited				some of the better names in the Marathon community such as Goran Svensson, in addition to				Eternal Project veterans Don-Martin Antell and Adam Ashwell, and talented newcomer				Andreas Nuyts, to commence the Xeventh Project: the push to create Eternal X, the really-this-time, I'm-not-kidding				final version of the game. I gave them				instructions to play through it and fix anything that they thought wasn't up to their				own standards. I worked with them to improve the textures to better suit their maps.<BR>				<BR>				But it seems that Mark V needed more work than I anticipated, and many of the team members				found it easier to completely scrap some levels than to fix their many flaws. So the				Xeventh Project became less of a spit-shine and more of a complete remodel, which took, rather				than the six or seven months I had hoped (aiming for an Eternal X release of July 25th, 2005),				over three years, punctuated by five incomplete Alpha releases, one as each chapter was finished,				the last being released on July 7th, 2007 (incidentally, shortly after Eternal Mark V surpassed				the 10,000 downloads mark). But though it was a long wait, I put this time to good use, polishing up the				textures and graphics while the mappers remodelled, recruiting Craig Hardgrove and Nick Singer to contribute their				beautiful Marathon music remixes, relearning MML and implementing some more advanced features, etc.<BR>				<BR>				In the meantime parts of the game were radically changed. Chapter 5 lost all but a 				superficial shadow of the Halo connections introduced by association with the Anomatic project,				and due to an inability to find a character artist able to create new monsters for the chapter,				I harkened back to Pathways Into Darkness, and made the nightmares of that classic Bungie game				the enemies of this final chapter. Multiplayer options were also removed due to inability to				find an artist to remodel the weapons and player sprites to be suitable for network play. But by early				2008, Eternal X was polished enough to warrant its first Final Candidate release; and by the end of February,				after five Final Candidates in total, Eternal X was at long last released to the public.<BR>				<BR>				FINISH THIS			</FONT>		</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><?php include "http://eternal.bungie.org/includes/footer.html"; ?>	</BODY></HTML>
