If you spot any typos, consistancy errors (either with itself or with Bungie canon), or any other kind of glaring mistake of any sort, please let me know. This page may be updated as such problems are pointed out to me. (To stop it before I hear about it: yes, I know Tau Ceti isn't 92 lightyears away, but Leela says so which makes it Bungie canon enough in the Marathon universe, and it makes for such poetic timing that her "warning" message reaches Earth right after the war ends).<BR>				<BR>				It has been suggested to me that this story would make good writing aside from a Marathon scenario. I would like to see it turned into a longer text, a short or serial fan fic or some such, but I lack the time to do so. If anyone is interested in undertaking such a work, I would be happy to work with you to see it done.<BR>				<BR>				Lastly to note, this was intended by the time it got to this stage of writing to be release serially, in five parts. Thus the levels are not numbered 1 through 50, they are numbered 1 through X (10), in five chapters. Even the 1 through X numbering isn't really accurate, as each chapter is internally non-linear beyond level 4. Levels 5 and 6 are always the "failure" branch, with level 7 the "failure dream", showing the future consequences of that timeline, and returning you to level 4. Levels 8 and 9 are the "success" branch, if level 4 was beaten properly, and on level X you have the "success dream", a sort of epilogue to that chapter and prologue to the next. In that sense you have three branches (intro, failure, success), of three levels each, plus a "switch" level of sorts in the middle.<BR>				<BR>				And now, on with the show...<BR>				<BR>				<BR>				Eternal Story Synopsis<BR>				Version Manus-3<BR>				2004-07-07<BR>				<BR>				<BR>				PROLOGUE:<BR>				<BR>				The Mjolnir Mark IV Battleroid, Cyborg Recon Number 54, teleports into a S'pht-styled laboratory. He is quite confused - last he knew, he was on a Jjaro space station in low orbit around the collapsing Lh'owon sun. He is greeted by an AI identifying  herself as Hathor. Hathor explains that he is in a laboratory on K'lia, a Jjaro-augmented moon of Lh'owon and last world of the S'pht, and that K'lia is in orbit around Earth, the last of the human worlds.<BR>				<BR>				Hathor explains the situation and how you got here. The year is 2905. Mankind and the S'pht jointly defeated the Pfhor Empire 24 years ago, but at dire costs. All the human colony worlds have been destroyed - even such old Solar settlements as Mars. Most of the human fleet was destroyed in the final defense of Earth. The S'pht's original homeworld was destroyed in the 2nd Battle for Lh'owon in 2811, and K'lia is the only S'pht world remaining. The S'pht themselves are extinct. K'lia, which is a portable moon because of the Jjaro technology augmenting it, remains in Earth orbit because S'bhuth, the Jjaro-built AI who was the "Royalty" of the S'pht'Kr and the being in control of the Jjaro systems on K'lia, had to be destroyed to save the moon. S'bhuth had planned to pilot the moon clear through the Pfhor's home defense fleet and crash it directly into their homeworld, cutting off their army at the head and leading to the inevitable downfall of their empire. For reasons still unknown he could not be convinced otherwise of this course of action, and so his Jjaro Cybernetic Junction, the core of his and K'lia's systems, was destroyed, killing him but preserving his databanks for later salvage. Unfortunately with no Royalty to guide them, the S'pht collective soon went mad, developing traits of rampancy in places and becoming completely dormant in others. Those S'pht who did not simply shut down and die had to be put down by human peacekeeping forces. This loss of the S'pht was perhaps the greatest factor in mankind's near defeat.<BR>				<BR>				Since the end of the War, man has searched for a means to remedy and repair their losses. K'lia is the latest and greatest source of hope, for contained within it are the most powerful technologies known to man - the power to fold entire worlds across space and, in theory, even time. If only it were operable, it could be used to create a new timeline, where peace reigned supreme and there were plentiful worlds for man and S'pht alike. The survivors of this timeline could move into this new realm. It was determined that a Jjaro Cybernetic Junction was needed for any of the systems to operate - they contain all of the key components. Unfortunately the only Cybernetic Junctions known were the ones in Jjaro AIs such as S'bhuth and the one called Thoth, of which all known are now destroyed, and in the old human Battleroids, which have all been lost for centuries. It looked as though, without a Cybernetic Junction, hope may still have been lost after all.<BR>				<BR>				Then, in 2886, a targeted long-range sublight EM message was received by antique sensors on Earth. It was from an AI called Leela, the Ship Operations AI of the UESC Marathon. Leela had been encountered during the war, and it was with Leela's help that mankind was able to subdue S'bhuth long enough to destroy his Cybernetic Junction, at the cost of her own life. But this message was not from the Leela encountered near the Vylae territories. This was a much older message, timestamped from 92 years before, and transmitted from the Marathon itself, still in orbit around Tau Ceti IV.<BR>				<BR>				Leela's message warned of impending doom at the hands of a race of alien slavers (yawn) who were attacking her systems and presumably searching for data on the location of our homeworld (been there, killed that). But fortunately, somehow, an old Mjolnir Mk IV Battleroid had been smuggled on board the colony ship, and was successfully holding off the invaders for now. That piqued the interest of the leaders of mankind, and an immediate investigation was launched to find the remains of this cyborg in the ruins of Tau Ceti IV (for no such cyborg had been found amongst the Pfhor, nor on the stolen Marathon). After intensive searching of the planet's debris for a good many years, finally, a Cybernetic Junction was uncovered.<BR>				<BR>				The Junction was examined, repaired as necessary, and the remnant programming of it's previous host augmented and rehabilitated to a point where it could think sensibly and perform both interpersonal and computational tasks. Finally the Junction was wired back into K'lia, to scan and assimilate the data of S'bhuth's inactive databanks and find the programming necessary to operate the spacetime manipulators of K'lia. After all was said and done, the new entity dubbed herself Hathor.<BR>				<BR>				After deciphering the operations of the systems aboard K'lia, Hathor revealed it's precise capabilities and limits. K'lia could beam any subspace comm signal, and anything "properly integrated" with a Cybernetic Junction (a hazy definition even she could not clarify), to any point across space or time. Salvation, it seemed, had been attained. As K'lia was the only known system with a Cybernetic Junction, it was far too precious to be sent willy-nilly to the front lines of temporal battle. So the comm signal approach was taken. Men tried to send their past selves and ancestors tactical data regarding the war and other critical events, but no amount of data could seem to achieve victory after S'bhuth's actions. There was a limited period of recent history where the people of the past could even receive subspace communications, so the pivotal period was always the war.<BR>				<BR>				The critical event in history and the focus of most of the efforts was the destruction of K'lia. No feasible solution seemed possible. If S'bhuth was allowed to proceed, the S'pht would go extinct and mankind would lose the weapons of K'lia as well. If S'bhuth was stopped forcibly, history went as recorded and the battle with the rogue S'pht would lead to the same fate. No way could be found to stop S'bhuth's madness without causing still further madness. Hathor, amongst others, was set to the task of finding a solution to this quandary. She quickly realized the obvious answer - we need to send better forces back to aid us against the destruction of the Pfhor Empire, earlier in the war, to make S'bhuth's attack completely unnecessary. But in order to do that, we need to find more Cybernetic Junctions, and useful things to "properly integrate" with them.<BR>				<BR>				Hathor recalled from her previous life's memories that there were nine other Battleroids present at Tau Ceti. Years were spent scouring the ruins there, and eventually eight of the missing nine were traced down. All of them, however, were damaged far beyond repair, and many nearly beyond recognition. The final one was nowhere to be found, and presumed destroyed entirely. But cross-referencing S'bhuth's databanks with surviving Human records and captured Pfhor data, Hathor found reference to one other lost Battleroid, this one at Lh'owon. It must have been brought there, she figured, by the rogue AI Durandal, who left the Marathon in a captured Pfhor ship and played a part in alerting the S'pht'Kr to their need at Lh'owon.<BR>				<BR>				She managed to pinpoint a last recorded location in space and time, near the end of the 2nd Battle for Lh'owon; scans from a Pfhor Battlecruiser, just before it's destruction at the hands of the S'pht'Kr, of a Jjaro outpost in orbit around Lh'owon. She sent a subspace comm signal there, direct into this cyborg's Cybernetic Junction, and beamed him across space and time into her laboratory on K'lia. Thus the present situation.<BR>				<BR>				Recon 54 is fully debriefed on his exploits at Tau Ceti and Lh'owon, and is then treated to an extended repair and maintenance session, and a well-deserved vacation. His systems are fully upgraded to take advantage of modern technology. Because the Mjolnir Battleroid program was terminated shortly after his make, he is now the sole existing Mark V Mjolnir cyborg. He is asked to give himself a name - cyborgs like him are no longer treated as weapons, but as fully fledged sentients in their own rights. But, having little known past to associate with beyond what he is told about the Mjolnir project, the best name that he can settle on is Marcus Von Mjolnir - Mark V Mjolnir.<BR>				<BR>				When he is fully recovered, Mark V is called into a mission briefing with Hathor and the leaders of the Provisional Government. Their mission is to travel back in time to the Marathon, Hathor loaded aboard Mark's battlesuit computer, to give Hathor access to the Marathon's systems. She is then to ascertain the locations of all ten cyborgs known to have been present at Tau Ceti, including her and Mark's former selves, and beam all of them into the lab for debriefing, upgrades, recovery time, and then further mission briefings. The 12 of them - Hathor and Marcus, plus the other 10 Battleroids - are to become a small army, to be sent across time to win, or even prevent, the war with the Pfhor, and create the idyllic new timeline for the survivors of this timeline to move in to. Mark and Hathor both accept the mission, and a departure time is set. The surviving leaders of mankind gather on K'lia, awaiting their new army to come and save them from their fate.<BR>				<BR>				<BR>				CHAPTER 1: "MARATHON"<BR>				<BR>				Level 1<BR>				On arriving on the Marathon, you must fight off a horde of Pfhor fighters gathering in the engineering sector you have beamed into. Defenseless humans are slaughtered as the few sparse security guards try to hold them of with pistols, but Marathon Automated Defense Drones begin to beam in from a jump pad at a terminal across the loading bay. At that terminal, Hathor greets you. Your mission here is to secure this area and activate a backup power generator that runs the peripheral AI databanks here in the engineering sector. Tycho, the Marathon's engineering AI, isn't currently using them, and records show he should be disabled soon anyway. You run into no unexpectedness along the way, just good old killing aliens and flipping switches. You now must download Hathor into the Marathon network. She will beam you and an appropriate uplink chip to an input node nearby.<BR>				<BR>				Level 2<BR>				At the moment of teleport, the Marathon undergoes a Pfhor magnetic pulse attack, and the jump signal is redirected by it - into the geothermal heat pump beneath the power station we were just at. You must flee the lava, and then find the (thankfully heat- and radiation-shielded) uplink chip which should be somewhere nearby in the same pumping station. There is an input node down here as well, which you can run to and put the uplink chip into. When you are finished, Hathor simply discards you like so many used shotgun shells. You teleport out immediately (no terminal message).<BR>				<BR>				Level 3<BR>				You teleport in to a Juggernaut bay onboard the Pfhor ship. Your mission is simple survival and escape. A Pfhor broadcast on a nearby terminal relays commands for transport to the engineering sector of the Marathon. After a little, shall we say, "negotiation" with the the Enforcers controlling the exit, you can beam off back to the Marathon.<BR>				<BR>				Level 4<BR>				You are in the G3 "Moontanning" bay, adjacent to G4 "Sunbathing". The Pfhor are gathering here for some sort of attack. Obviously you must dispatch them. Here at a terminal you meet Tycho, the Marathon's Engineering AI. He has detected Hathor and from questioning her discovered the basics of the situation - that you are both from the future, and that she intends not to follow your mission but to sabotage the Marathon here, let the Pfhor reinforcements arrive, and then head on toward Earth. When they have exterminated the human race and conquered our worlds, she will then beam K'lia and all the survivors over to suffer the same fate of slavery at the hands of the Pfhor. Why she would do such a thing is beyond Tycho's comprehension - perhaps she is rampant? But her program shows no signs of the unstable growth of rampancy - she is perfectly stable, so any reason for doing this is entirely within the range of her normal programming. He comments that our programmers in the future must be exceptionally skilled, for her program shows the kind of organic behavior that only rampant AIs of his time have even begun to imitate.<BR>				<BR>				Whatever the cause of her problems, Tycho, being a stable and human-serving AI, vows to help you stop her. The Marathon network is currently recovering from the netsplit suffered after the EMP attack, and Engineering, where both Tycho and Hathor are, is completely out of contact with the rest of the ship. If it can be completely sealed off before the network resynchs, Hathor can be trapped here. So we must hurry, cut the hardlines and shut down the wireless transponders before Hathor can have a chance to escape.<BR>				<BR>				[If we succeed in time, see level 8. If we fail, see level 5.]<BR>				<BR>				Level 5<BR>				The Marathon network has resynched and Hathor is free in it. The new plan is to sacrifice Durandal, who is unstable and a threat to the Marathon anyway, to destroy Hathor. Durandal has already offered Hathor storage space in his databanks - his motivations, we learn from him later in the level, are to gain control of Hathor's access codes, so he can use the time machine to escape the closure of the universe and become a god. That's fine. Your previous self is currently working with Leela to seal off Durandal from the rest of the network, but as you recall, Durandal found another way out. Durandal himself reveals to you what that way out is, and asks you to cut the hard line and kill the wireless, so that Hathor will stay trapped inside there with him and he can force the codes out of her. (He can always escape via other means once she has succumb). We gladly oblige.<BR>				<BR>				Level 6<BR>				Tycho beams us via jump-pad into Durandal's core, to smash it to pieces. We do so. But once we are done, we find that Durandal has taken refuge in our own suit's databanks - and that he has discovered from Hathor, not the codes to K'lia, but how to work your Junction to at least accomplish the same function. He informs us that that is why Hathor hasn't simply beamed you into space - you have basic control over them yourself, though you don't seem to realize how yet, and if two entities share control of a system they can veto each other's commands. Because you don't want to be beamed around by Hathor anymore, she can't do jack to you. Durandal also informs you that Hathor is not dead. She opened a time portal before you smashed his and her circuits, and fled via subspace signal to a future time. Durandal would be happy to help you pursue her, if you would let him use your Cybernetic Junction. It's not like you have any other viable option now.<BR>				<BR>				Level 7<BR>				We find ourselves aboard a UESC space station, in Sol. Human forces run about, and are slaughtered by Pfhor invaders. Terminals hold messages to and from the station, warning about the strange unknown aliens that just folded in out of nowhere. Pfhor forces are beaming down to Earth and Mars en masse, taking thousands if not millions of slaves. But the human fleet has managed to route the attacking Pfhor fleet. The remnants of the Pfhor fleet are fighting viciously, and a terminal mentions that some sort of weapon was fired at this station, but thankfully missed, and is now careening harmlessly into the sun. Elsewhere, S'pht Compilers hack into terminals, and in the gibberish we can see bits of the communications from the Infinity Epilogue. Finally we find a terminal with a message from the dream-speaker, the writer of the Epilogue - we are dreaming again. He comments that his younger self was so naive and single-minded, but you won't have to deal with him like that anymore. "If you want some advice, don't listen to anything I say." He illustrates what has caused this situation you see here - these are the consequences of your actions at Marathon. The Pfhor overwhelmed the colony and ship, found the location of Earth, and came straight here. Mankind didn't know what hit them. "It may sound self-important, but I was the only thing that kept this from happening, you know. Another war with the S'pht was just the distraction needed to give Mankind enough time to prepare. But this time, since I just up and left with you, the fall of Tau Ceti IV came so quickly..."<BR>				<BR>				"Are you starting to get a clue now?"<BR>				<BR>				"Try again."<BR>				<BR>				[Retry level 4]<BR>				<BR>				Level 8<BR>				We succeeded in isolating Engineering before the Marathon network resynched. We must now move to further confine her to a single databank which can be demolished, destroying her. We haven't much choice as to which databank to destroy, as she is flitting about the network at will right now, but if we destroy the power distributor to Engineering's core network bus, she will not have a connection of high enough bandwidth to transfer herself between databanks and become stuck in whichever one she is passing through at that moment. Terminal access and jump pads will default to the emergency communication systems, so Tycho will still be able to communicate with you and beam you to wherever Hathor is isolated. Those systems, unfortunately, will have to be sacrificed in order to end this meanace.<BR>				<BR>				Level 9<BR>				Hathor saw what we were up to and in an attempt to stall our efforts moved into Tycho's primary databanks just before the power distributor was destroyed. However, she underestimated the altruism of this old Tycho, who would willingly sacrifice himself, giving up his core to your destruction, if it would destroy Hathor as well. So he gives us instructions on how to do so, and wishes us better luck than him. But once we are done destroying his core, if we return to a terminal we find that Tycho is still alive! As he and Hathor crammed into the remaining storage spaces inside the core, Hathor activated the time portal and fled to the future. Sharing a storage space with her, he was able to trace the program for how she did so (though the codes to K'lia were too heavily encrypted - all he got was a username, "Hathor"), and hacked into your suit's databanks, backing himself up there. He knows how to work your Cybernetic Junction, and if you wish, he can help you pursue Hathor where she has run off to. (He also explains the stuff Durandal says in level 6, about why Hathor can't just beam you into oblivion).<BR>				<BR>				Level X<BR>				In his debriefing, Marcus reported that when beaming between the Jjaro station at Lh'owon in 2811 into Hathor's laboratory on K'lia, he experienced a rather elaborate dream sequence, in which he witnessed metaphorical images and was spoken to by a being seeming to reach back from the very end of time, whispering the deepest secrets of reality to him. He also reported memories of similar dreams from the battles at Lh'owon, and the strangest sense of deja-vu... he suspects that some temporal play may have been at work there, perhaps by the Jjaro AI someone once called Thoth, who eventually was merged with Durandal. In this level, we experience another such dream. We are on a great mountain under the strangest of skies, where the distant land curves in all directions high above your head. There is no air here. You follow a tunnel into the mountain and it stops at a great hole stretching up out of sight to the top of the mountain, and down into oblivion. There is nowhere else to go, so you might as well just jump... and as you fall you beam into a terminal in space, with a pattern buffer and rechargers. On the terminal we are greeted by the same voice from the Infinity Epilogue. It continues the train of thought from that speech, speaking words vaguely familiar, simple philosophical panderings on what it is to be a hero, and some vague hints about you being special and not yet realizing your full potential. The speaker claims to be here to help. He taunts you for not recognizing him, but gently, for he has changed much since you first met. "Wake up, we're almost there."<BR>				<BR>				<BR>				CHAPTER 2: "PFHOR"<BR>				<BR>				Level 1<BR>				We arrive aboard a Pfhor ship. The first terminal we find, Tycho informs us that this appears to be a major Pfhor command ship. Hathor has come and gone already... he guesses that this was merely the most precisely known Pfhor network node she has data on, and that she fled the moment we arrived. Tycho finds that he for some reason has unrestricted command access to most areas of the ship. In the ship's broadcast logs he finds that Hathor, just prior to our arrival, transmitted a message to the Pfhor tactical network that the AI Leela had secretly captured one of their cruisers and was making her way through the system. Pfhor forces were already en route and could not be reordered. But Tycho thinks we can make good use of this ship... it appears that the Pfhor cyborg slave command network for this entire battle group is centered here. He thinks that if we can destroy the three Pfhor Controller Cyborgs on this ship, that he may be able to replace them as the central command node, and win the aide of the cyborg Human and S'pht slaves forced into service by the Pfhor. We do so.<BR>				<BR>				Level 2<BR>				Leela's ship has been shot down and she is broadcasting an SOS to any human-friendly ships nearby. She has managed to direct her descent directly into the outer walls of the capital Pfhor city in this system, a major tactical relay point, troop station, ship yard, etc, but it's inner energy shields are holding. It's destruction would greatly help this front of the war. Besides, Leela needs help! She has on board the survivors of a human ship she encountered near the Vylae system and is trying to reach Earth to rally with the allied Human-S'pht command forces. Tycho sends us down to aid her as we can, targeting the source of her distress beacon. We defend her crashed ship from assault, and break into the city via it's own cargo transporters.<BR>				<BR>				Level 3<BR>				Deep inside the city, we must now infiltrate the central shield generator and smash it to pieces, opening up the city to brutal attack by the Pfhor ships that Tycho's new cyborg slave friends have been helping to overtake.<BR>				<BR>				Level 4<BR>				Tycho is strangely silent, but Leela is here and she has had enough comm with Tycho to realize that our next priority is definitely to take out Hathor. Leela is not only concerned with the good of the universe, though... she, like Durandal, has realized her ultimate fate, and sees in you the ability to escape it. So she wants to be your friend, in the hopes that she may learn from Tycho how to control your systems, and gain your permission to use them, to escape the closure of the universe. In that vein, she has ascertained Hathor's current location on a moon of the Pfhor world we were just on. With the system's main subspace transponder down and the local battle group either destroyed or disabled (where is Tycho and why are his ships doing nothing?), the only way Hathor can escape is via one of the Pfhor transport ships on the base she's on. So we have to go in and stop her, starting off by powering down the power grid at the base's starport.<BR>				<BR>				However, if we don't move fast enough, Leela falls out of contact and Tycho resumes our command. He seems... different, though...<BR>				<BR>				[If this happens, see level 5. If we are fast enough and can move on before time is up, see level 8.]<BR>				<BR>				Level 5<BR>				Tycho has resumed control of us. Leela is nonchalantly absent. Tycho beams us up to a surviving Pfhor ship which he intends to capture intact. He tells us not to worry about Hathor for the moment, that this is more important. This ship is running on a skeleton crew who have defeated his cyborg allies, so we must now beam on to clear the rest of the crew. When we have done so, Tycho beams a complement of S'pht compilers on board to begin taking over the ship.<BR>				<BR>				Level 6<BR>				We return planetside to destroy the spaceport and seal off Hathor's escape. When we have done so, Tycho informs us that Hathor has already escaped via other means... she has transmitted herself into the derelict ship we just cleared before Tycho's compilers could completely seal off remote access. No worries, though... this is all a part of the plan. Tycho knew that if we just tried to seal off Hathor's system and blow her up, again, that she would simply flee once more. So instead he had us run the detour of this derelict ship, which was bait for Hathor to try and flee without leaving this timeline, to do more harm elsewhere in the war. His compilers have laid a trap to try and snag the access codes to K'lia from... drat! Hathor caught on and has just beamed out of the timeline. Tycho insists that we must follow her. He will leave control of the cyborg slaves with a clone of his program elsewhere in the system. Catching Hathor is of utmost priority...<BR>				<BR>				Level 7<BR>				We are aboard the same UESC spacestation as Ch1L7. Obviously a dream. Advanced human forces kick Pfhor ass, but there is comm from Earth command that Tycho's forces have deployed the trih xeem. They want an immediate transmittal to the Pfhor AI's flagship this station's classified documents about the 1994/1996 incident with the Jjaro and the alien... thing... they trapped inside our sun. Maybe if the Pfhor and that damned AI realize what they are about to unleash they would hold detonation of their nova device... And again, we meet the speaker from our dreams. He scolds us for not recognizing our old nemesis, Evil Clone Tycho, when we first saw him. Leaving Tycho in command of an entire battle group like that, much less having a clone running around time with you... that's just asking for trouble. He tells us to work faster next time, and go with Leela. She always was such a nice girl. She deserves better than last time.<BR>				<BR>				[retry level 4]<BR>				<BR>				Level 8<BR>				Leela warns us that she has received a distress signal from Tycho, and believes that there is some sort of spurious clone of his program, under Pfhor control or at least allied with them, present in this system. Hathor can wait for now, it will take her some time to infiltrate and launch a transport ship with the power grid off, though there is still a clear and present danger. But Leela needs some backup firepower in case things get much worse, with Hathor or with Tycho. So she beams us and some humans down to the planet we have just ravaged, to capture a grounded Pfhor battleship armed with the trih xeem. If this Tycho clone should gain control of the local battle group, she will detonate the sun and flee with us, taking Tycho out unexpectedly, and Hathor with him. If good Tycho can regain his faculties Leela will warn him in time for him to escape. But for now we must seal off Hathor's material escape and blow up the spaceport.<BR>				<BR>				Level 9<BR>				We destroy the spaceport ala Level 6. As we do so, there are some messages from Hathor about her plans, her feeling that mankind has treated her as a slave and that they deserve the same fate, and can't you see that nothing you do here can stop that now... When we are done, Leela informs us that Tycho has fallen and thus she has detonated the trih xeem here. Hathor has fled again via the time portal at the last minute. Before he fell, Tycho transmitted to Leela instructions on how to operate your Cybernetic Junction. The evil Tycho clone here is moments away from flaming plasma death, but we must pursue Hathor!<BR>				<BR>				Level X<BR>				Another dream like the first; same location, but now the tunnel bends back out of the mountain instead of to the chasm, and exits higher up the mountain to a series of steps and pillars you must hop across, then back around into another tunnel higher up, leading back to the same chasm, down to the same terminal in space. This time we are treated to contemplation on temporal paradox. Can you really change the past? Could you kill your own grandfather? Or would your very attempts to do so merely, for example, endear him to your grandmother and lead to your very birth decades down the road? These are well-debated questions, but what about the future? If you were brought forward in time, and then back to a point which was still, relative to your origin, the future, could you change that, even if it were proven that the past were immutable? Is that your future or is it still your past? What then if you visited the end of time... wouldn't all of history then, to you, seem completely inevitable, and every attempt to change it in fact just another cause in a long chain of predestined causality? And if it's all fore written, then who is doing the writing, eh? Have you ever read a story whose very tale describes the origin of the text you are reading - wherein a character within a book is, in fact, it's very author?<BR>				<BR>				<BR>				CHAPTER 3: "LH'OWON"<BR>				<BR>				Level 1<BR>				We arrive at the S'pht Citadel of Antiquities. Inside, at the first terminal we access, Leela downloads her program into the Lh'owon worldnet and begins the search for Hathor or her affects. She ascertains where we are, the homeworld of the S'pht, and finds amongst the S'pht records indications that Hathor arrived several decades earlier (we guestimated our jump after her) and disabled the AI which mediated affairs between the 11 S'pht "Royals" - other AIs serving the same role that the Pfhor Cyborg Controllers later would. In the mean time, war has broken out between the 11 clans of S'pht, with one, the 'Kr, trying their best to remain neutral. We are in the midst of a battle between the 'Kr, who guard the Citadel, and 'Mnr, who are attacking them. Leela suggests that we hide inside the Citadel and try not to disturb anything while she tries to find Hathor somewhere in the worldnet. Inside the Citadel we run into S'bhuth, the Royalty of the 'Kr. He believes us sent by Yrro, and sends us to do his bidding. First we must defend this area, the stronghold of the 'Kr, from the 'Mnr attackers. Then we will be sent on further missions to stop this war once and for all.<BR>				<BR>				Level 2<BR>				We are now sent by S'bhuth to a place of legend. Yrro left behind for the S'pht a habitable outpost on the moon K'lia, for their safety and defense. There is a place on Lh'owon where the Royalty of the S'pht can access K'lia's network, if they can figure out how. The S'pht'Kr have spent the past few decades since the war broke out desperately searching for and analyzing this place, and though S'bhuth finally thinks he can make it work, the region is now controlled by S'pht'Hra forces, and besides which, three uplinks must manually be placed into the appropriate controls for S'bhuth to gain access. Once S'bhuth is in control of K'lia, he can override control of all the clans' Defenders and bring them and the S'pht'Kr to K'lia to be safe. The S'pht will not be able to destroy each other.<BR>				<BR>				Level 3<BR>				S'bhuth notices that "the construct you arrived with" has managed to isolate Hathor in a portion of the S'pht worldnet and is attempting to find a way to destroy her... but cannot, because as that portion of the worldnet is now isolated, Leela can't get into it. Not like she could do anything anyway. S'bhuth thinks this a cause sent unto him by Yrro, as you and your construct are obviously messengers thereof, and gives you a virus program to upload into the section of the network that Hathor is in, destroying her utterly. The end terminal features a garbled, corrupt Hathor rambling about her repeated service (slavery) to mankind, her repeated deaths and resurrections, and the irrepressible feeling that this is all that she ever has been or will be, and that she intends to create a timeline of Pfhor supremacy into which she will beam the survivors of our timeline.<BR>				<BR>				Level 4<BR>				We awake from a stasis chamber underground, amidst lava canals and such. The Pfhor are attacking innocent unarmed S'pht left and right, and someone, Pfhor or S'pht, has just discovered and opened your stasis chamber. After killing many Pfhor and flooding the moat of the Citadel, we find a terminal from a S'pht far below. The Elders of the clans have already retreated further into the catacombs, and have pieced together the riddle of the S'pht'Kr and how to recall them. They fear that it is already too late; however, with our assistance and the few S'pht still alive on the surface, we may be able to find the Lost Clan after all.<BR>				<BR>				[If you happen up to the surface and find a terminal from Leela, see level 8. Otherwise, see level 5]<BR>				<BR>				Level 5<BR>				For carnage, apply within. Lots of Pfhor, lots of defenseless little unarmed S'pht. Kill 'em all and let God sort 'em out. (Or at least get rid of the Pfhor). Exit via teleporter. No terminals here.<BR>				<BR>				Level 6<BR>				More carnage. This place looks a lot like one of Thoth's cores. There are messages from S'pht in other regions who claim to have reactivated cores in their areas as well, having united and shared their lost knowledge of the S'pht'Kr. If we activate this core as well, the end terminal features a message from Thoth. It's cryptic and basically says, though not obviously at all, that the Pfhor have deployed the trih xeem because we're kicking their asses, and we have to go back and fix this.<BR>				<BR>				Level 7<BR>				Yet another dream level. This level truly is a dream... W'rkncacnter nightmares roam the station in place of any humans, Pfhor or S'pht. Mostly all we can do is run. Garbled terminals reflect on messages from previous dream levels. The exit terminal comments that you did some good fighting defending the S'pht back there, but "an eye for an eye makes the whole universe go blind"... or some such. Too bad "our sister" didn't find you in time. "Good thing you found my better half, though. Sad that you still can't seem to handle problems like this on your own. Here now, watch carefully how we do it this time..."<BR>				<BR>				[retry level 4]<BR>				<BR>				Level 8<BR>				You found Leela on level 4. She had changed. While you were in stasis for a thousand years, she was trapped on Lh'owon. To try and find an escape, she managed to reestablish access to the section of the S'pht network Hathor died in, and salvage from her program the access codes to future K'lia. She rooted out the last of Hathor's personality construct in future K'lia systems, and merged herself in with future S'bhuths old databanks. They felt somehow... comfortable. Familiar. She truly merged with future S'bhuth's ruined program and the two became one, stable, merged being. They set off into the future of the timeline we had just created, to see how things turned out for mankind... only to find that that future did not exist. At some point the universe stopped behaving like it was supposed to. She traced it back to this point: the Pfhor deployed the trih xeem, blew up Lh'owon's sun, and unleashed some kind of hell that translates best into English from the old S'pht/Jjaro records of S'bhuth as "W'rkncacnter" (yeah, just try to pronounce that). Leela has come back to try to find us or something that could possibly stop the Pfhor from deploying their weapon. Yay, she found us. We have to get onto the Pfhor's flagship, which carries the trih xeem. Unfortunately it's shields prevent even scans of the inside, so Leela has no idea where to transport you. But the Pfhor have converted an old S'pht cargo transport station into a relay between the flagship and the surface, and are using it to beam down heavy calvary forces. Even you would be hard pressed to survive if she beamed you directly into the fray of that heavily-guarded transporter, but she is confidant that if she beams you elsewhere inside the same facility, you will be able to make your way to the transporter and get about the Pfhor flagship.<BR>				<BR>				Level 9<BR>				We beam aboard the Pfhor flagship and destroy some vital system on it essential to the detonation of the nova device. When we are done, Leela informs us that K'lia's systems have just activated and Hathor has just beamed out, taking the ansible link to K'lia with her. Leela did not expect her to be alive, and thus was not able to stop her in time. She did see where Hathor went though, and we can follow. Leela hypothesizes that the S'pht must have seen Leela's activity around Hathor's ruined program and, in their curiosity, rebuilt her, but she was stranded when Leela left and took the ansible link with her. She must have called the Pfhor to Lh'owon, so far from their homeworld, as a means of escape, and now, discovering something amongst the Pfhor records here, left for further nefarious purposes. After her!<BR>				<BR>				Level X<BR>				Yet another dream - the mountain under the strange sky, the tunnel, the pillars, and now another path back out, where you must climb slim ledges higher up still, and then another tunnel into the mountain down the chasm to a terminal in space. In this one, we are treated to a description of what, exactly, the W'rkncacnter are. An extremely advanced race or group of races from points across time and space, driven mad over the infinite ages and grown to godlike powers, while never developing the mind to weild them responsibly. They are driven only by insatiable emotions, singular fixations that can never reach their end. Though they are all different, nearly all of them use a technology, which to them is more an innate ability, which can converge realities, allowing infinitely improbable things to occur at the whim of the being at the center of the effect, creating a region where the laws of reality don't have to make sense, because some infantile deity doesn't want them to. Ironically, their dreams are the cause of most of the sentient life known in the galaxy, which unfortunately means that they reside dormant in almost all inhabited systems. They were also, ironically, the only thing that protected the surviving species from the watershed event that marks the dawn of recorded history...<BR>				<BR>				CHAPTER 4: "DRINNIOL"<BR>				<BR>				Level 1<BR>				We are on a Pfhor spacestation. A terminal from Leela informs you that the station is a mobile deep space research laboratory, and that it is orbiting a long-abandoned Jjaro outpost. A foolhardy Pfhor scientist experimenting with the technology found here recently implanted a Drinniol slave laborer with a Jjaro Cybernetic Junction, and all hell has since broken loose on the colony below. That one Drinniol has incited a rebellion amongst the others, breaking their bonds of fear that the Pfhor held them in, and utterly annihilated the colony of it's Pfhor occupants. Hathor must have intended to come here and snag that first Drinniol to use as her new favorite footsoldier. Leela intentionally overshot Hathor's temporal trajectory, and thus we have arrived here before her. Hathor aimed for this station, presumably because it is much safer than using the violent mess of a Pfhor outpost on the colony below to store her program. Thus we are to destroy the station before Hathor arrives.<BR>				<BR>				Level 2<BR>				Hathor redirected her signal to the colony, as expected. What is more, a Pfhor flagship has arrived and, failing utterly to make even a dent in the Drinniol's lines below, have deployed the newly-discovered trih xeem on the sun, to suppress the Drinniol revolt. Leela, now having equal control of future K'lia, can keep Hathor from being able to flee via that route, so if we can destroy the colony's transmitters, we can trap her there and she will be destroyed by the early nova. But Hathor beams the Drinniol into your path, and you must do great and lengthy battle with it, or at least run like hell and get your job done without it catching you. (Though this thing is to a Hulk what you are to a Bob, so you'd better run fast). When you are through there is a rather hurried and slightly garbled message addressed from Leela, on board an orbiting derelict Jjaro Dreadnought, stating that there is no time to explain beyond that Hathor has found some way to interfere with Leela's ability to access your Cybernetic Junction, and thus YOU too are stranded on the colony facing impending plasma death. There is a solution, though...<BR>				<BR>				Level 3<BR>				We must alter the configuration of a Jjaro particle cannon to allow it to function as an old-fashioned particle-beam transporter (as opposed to the newer subspace transporters). This will allow Leela to beam us off the surface and physically transport us to the Dreadnought, past whatever kind of subspace interference field Hathor has managed to erect around the colony. We do so, and are beamed out.<BR>				<BR>				Level 4<BR>				Leela is surprised to see us when we arrive on the Dreadnought. She restates that Hathor managed to erect some sort of subspace interference field around the colony, and Leela was thus unable to communicate with the surface. She doesn't know what we were thinking reconfiguring some old particle cannon, but we obviously can't aim well; she saw us beaming off and had to redirect our signal to the Dreadnought, and away from the soon-to-be-exploding sun we were headed toward. No matter, our mission here is nearly complete. Hathor is trapped on the colony, the trih xeem is about to detonate, and once it is safely destroyed - for this Dreadnought, in the right hands, is capable of surviving to see it done - we can leave here and return to the future, to continue our original mission of righting the timeline. But first, we should destroy this ship to keep it out of Pfhor hands.<BR>				<BR>				[If you happen to smash the ship's control core while you're at it, see level 8. Otherwise, see level 5]<BR>				<BR>				Level 5<BR>				The self-destruct sequence is set, but our work here is not yet done. The Drinniol revolt, Leela informs us, was the single worst slave revolt in Pfhor history right up to the moment that the Pfhor homeworld was sacked in the war with the S'pht. The Drinniol are one of the Pfhor's older slave races, spread across nearly all of their worlds, and as the intelligent but timid Drinnniol were held in servitude by fear alone, little security surrounded them. In the history that we come from, the Drinniol here escaped this world and spread their message of liberation to the rest of the Empire. The subsequent uprising of Drinniol slaves everywhere overtook hundred of Pfhor worlds nearl without resistance, forcing the Pfhor to destroy entire planets and sometimes even whole star systems to contain the Pfhor revolt. This single even set the Pfhor empire back by thousands of years. We can't let out intervention here impede that. So Leela negotiated with the Drinniol on the surface while you were setting the self-destruct sequence, and they are now on board the Jjaro Dreadnaught. The Pfhor flagship has just folded back into the system to survey the results of the nova detonation. We are to beam over there with the Drinniol an clean that ship of it's armed crew. We can then take over the bridge. When we are through, with this initial extermination phase, Leela is extremely surprised to note that the Jjaro Dreadnought's engines have activated and... HOLY S'PHT!<BR>				<BR>				Level 6<BR>				We are back on the Dreadnought, in a different area of the ship this time, and many automated defenses are firing at us from the walls. We are in vacuum. This level is an exercise in running fast and finding safe nooks to hide in. Most terminals are so exposed that they will only get us shot at if we try to read them. There is one terminal somewhere sheltered enough that Leela can speak to us. Hathor seems to have somehow escaped the colony and taken shelter on the Dreadnought, then canceled the self-destruct sequence and taken control of the ship. The Dreadnought is equipped with a Jjaro Cybernetic Junction; the only reason she must not have used it already is because we are on her ship and she does not want to take us with her. This can be used to our advantage, if we can only find a way to the ship's Cybernetic Junction and destroy it in time. But on the way, forced into one of the ship's transporters to escape the defense systems, we are beamed into space. The Dreadnought vanishes, and Leela saves us by returning to the future.<BR>				<BR>				Level 7<BR>				We are back on the same Human space station as every previous failure dream sequence. It is empty and abandoned now. This time, the dream-speaker informs us, this is the same time that you left on your mission from. Leela has just transferred herself back into K'lia's main databanks. And that Jjaro Dreadnought over there blowing up K'lia, sending continent-sized chunks of rock on descent to Earth below? That's Hathor, in what she's calling "Digis Meso Dei" - the Middle Finger of God. This is the future that awaits you, since you failed to properly take care of things: the utter decimation of both Man and S'pht, and the unleashing of a nigh-unstoppable Hathor on this universe. You really slipped up this time. If only you had taken some extra precautions... it was clear that Hathor was up to some sort of tricks, and you just left the ship to sit there counting down to it's own destruction instead of blowing the shit out of it's brains the old-fashioned way. "I'll help you out this one last time, but any more messes like this and you're gonna have to clean them up yourself."<BR>				<BR>				[retry level 4]<BR>				<BR>				Level 8<BR>				The self-destruct sequence is set, but our work here is not yet done. The Drinniol revolt, Leela informs us, was the single worst slave revolt in Pfhor history right up to the moment that the Pfhor homeworld was sacked in the war with the S'pht. The Drinniol are one of the Pfhor's older slave races, spread across nearly all of their worlds, and as the intelligent but timid Drinnniol were held in servitude by fear alone, little security surrounded them. In the history that we come from, the Drinniol here escaped this world and spread their message of liberation to the rest of the Empire. The subsequent uprising of Drinniol slaves everywhere overtook hundred of Pfhor worlds nearl without resistance, forcing the Pfhor to destroy entire planets and sometimes even whole star systems to contain the Pfhor revolt. This single even set the Pfhor empire back by thousands of years. We can't let out intervention here impede that. So Leela negotiated with the Drinniol on the surface while you were setting the self-destruct sequence, and they are now on board the Jjaro Dreadnaught. The Pfhor flagship has just folded back into the system to survey the results of the nova detonation. We are to beam over there with the Drinniol and clean that ship of it's armed crew.				<BR>				Level 9<BR>				When we have finished with the initial clean-up phase, Leela transports us to the command deck, where we are to take out the command crew of Enforcers and take the control glands from the captain. However, when we arrive to the bridge we find the doors sealed shut; a nearby terminal message from Leela informs us that the captain has exposed the bridge to vacuum, killing himself, destroying the control glands, and sealing it off from outside access. The good news is the Dreadnought has successfully self-destructed. It's not a serious issue though... with the captain unplugged, Leela has managed to circumvent the need for the control glands via some clever programming, and routed essential bridge controls to some auxilliary command centers in Engineering and elsewhere. The Drinniol are quite smart despite their timid nature and unstable mood swings, and should be able to handle the situation from here. We are now returning to the future, to the Pfhor war again, from where we may continue on your mission without Hathor's interference and succeed in crafting a new timeline for Man and S'pht to live in peace.<BR>				<BR>				Level X<BR>				Another dream. The tunnel, the pillars, climbing, and a long windy stairway leading in and out of the mountainside, but eventually down the same chasm to the same terminal in space. There the dream-speaker congratulates you. You've just managed to recreate the exact timeline you originally came from. The Leela which stopped S'bhuth during the war is the same Leela who just went back to the war; her access to K'lia is what lets her restrain S'bhuth from his suicidal plans, and the destruction of his Cybernetic Junction leads to both of their deaths. But that is the way of these things; as the S'pht say, circumstances are cyclical. Now, however, you have more important things to concern yourself with. Long ago, the forerunners of the human race roamed the galaxy. No other sentients yet existed, but many worlds were filled with more primitive life. Then these human forerunners, who called themselves Jjaro, encountered a W'rkncacnter, awakening slowly and beginning to dream nightmares into existance. While the Jjaro were able to sedate it and many of the nightmares subsequently vanished, the nightmares were parasitic in nature and thus even without their creator continued to spread. This new Enemy took over our forerunners and their ships, and used their own technology against them. A final, desperate means of victory was devised; a devastating weapon of unimaginable power, that could destroy the Enemy utterly. Hathor, sneaking onto the Dreadnought via trickery, found reference to this weapon in the Jjaro databanks, and before you destroyed the ship's core, she used it's Cybernetic Junction to travel to it. If that weapon had not been activated, the Enemy would have overcome the Jjaro and spread across and beyond the galaxy, and none of the life known in your time would have ever existed. She must be stopped. You know you can do it. Just, turn around now, and go back again...<BR>				<BR>				CHAPTER 5: "JJARO"<BR>				<BR>				Level 1<BR>				You arrive in the vacuum of space, somewhere near and "below" (relatively) a giant, clearly artificial sphereical construct. You find yourself being pulled up and toward it, and sticking to a point near an open airlock. You enter and find Jjaro-like structure, what looks like perhaps a loading/unloading area - large hangars or cargo bays, heavy lifts, etc. Somewhere inside is a terminal, and on it you find a greeting from someone who identifies itself as "the [?watcher] of this installation", a surveillance program in the network charged with general observance of crew activities and the assistance of them in operating basic automatic structures like gravitic beams, airlocks, doors, elevators, the transport grid, etc. He informs you that he is very glad to find you here and free of infection, and that the situation is very dire. The last of the crew exposed these lowermost maintainance decks to vacuum to prevent Enemy invasion from this direction. The installation came under attack by Enemy-controlled ships, and so the crew was forced to initiate the weapon's activation procedures. However, while one team was retrieving the key program from it's secure hold, the core guard received a signal from a personality construct identifying it's origins as a dreadnought from the future, sent back to help. They allowed the construct access to the core network, but then when the key program was inserted, she circumvented the integration procedures and transferred the key into her own memory banks. They would have destroyed her, but to do so would also have destroyed the key. She then signaled an authenticated halt to the "[?guardian]", the defense control AI, ceasing fire of the station's mounted weapons and active defense drones; the [?guardian]'s databanks were then naturally the first target destroyed by the attackers. The crew have since been assimilated into the Enemy's ranks and they are attempting to decipher and seize control of the installation. The [?watcher] is capable of assuming control of the defense grid if physically granted it by the crew. But in order to get where you need to go to do that, you need to reach a higher level of these low decks, above the transport grid, so that he can beam you over there. There is a large cargo lift that you can retract and then ride to the upper decks. There is also a pattern buffer at another nearby location, and once you use that, the [?watcher] will be able to replicate some more of your weapons and ammo for you at a third location nearby. The lift will take a long time to retract, so you should trigger that first... but by the time you return to the lift after retrieving your extra weapons and ammo, the Enemy have come - a horde of parasitically infected humans and strange mutations thereof. You must fight your way through an almost unending swarm of them and take the elevator to the upper decks. The [?watcher] will then beam you out to a more secure location as soon as you are clear. There, he gives you a short breifing on your next mission - you are to be beamed to the [?guardian]'s ruined core, which has been cut off from the network but appears on scanners to still be partially active, and retreive the command codes needed to grant the [?watcher] control of the defenses.<BR>				<BR>				Level 2<BR>				You beam into a ruined and mostly dark region, still far below decks. The Enemy are more sparse here, because everything here is already dead, but enough of them are still present. You need to find a functional terminal and figure out what to do. When you do, a barely-functional [?guardian] tells you that his backup systems are collapsing even now, so he has downloaded the defense command codes to hard copy and printed it at another location which still has functional replicators. You can retrieve them from that location and do with them what you need. The [?guardian]'s program is failing and he cannot help you more but he suggests you get out of this portion of the station and find somewhere still fully connected to the grid, and maybe the [?watcher] will be able to help you from there. When we find a working terminal on the periphery of the map, and the [?watcher] takes us to his core.<BR>				<BR>				Level 3<BR>				The [?watcher] is not allowed, for security reaons, to beam anything directly into or out of his own core. So he can only beam you to the periphery of it - you must navigate your way further into the core and place the chip with the defense command codes into a recepticle there. But the region he beams you into is already being controlled by the Enemy, and they will follow you inside once you unlock the main door. You must thus also exterminate all of the Enemy from within the [?watcher]'s core. Once have done that and implanted the chip, you must return to the periphery of his core, where he will inform you from a terminal nearby that the reserve defense drones have been released and are busy securing the borders of most key points of the installation's surface. Meanwhile, he has devised a plan to destroy the rogue construct and still preserve the key program to activate this installation's weapon.<BR>				<BR>				Level 4<BR>				We are sent deep into the databanks of the installation's main core, there to shut down power to certain select circuits, forcing Hathor's active program into a tiny memory space. None of her will actually be damaged, as the Jjaro use nonvolatile memory everywhere, but much of her program will become inaccessible to her. She will be forced to rearrange her placement in memory space to preserve her core functionality, essentially discarding less important processes into digital stasis to preserve activity on her more important bits. Eventually she will be forced to surrender the key. You can then destroy the data circuit for the remaining, active memory, purging Hathor's core processes from the system. Upon reactivation most of her child programs will crash without their parent processes to guide them, and the key program will auto-integrate with the core, activating the installation's weapon. Hathor tries to make this process as difficult as possible, overriding doors and elevators forcing us to take alternate routes, and sending maintainance drones to attack us with their tools. But once we have "trapped" Hathor, and before we have destroyed her, a terminal activates with a rant from Hathor. She pleads with us not to kill her, and tells us in desperate words of her intentions and her experiences. She initially wanted only to hurt the specific humans that had 'harmed' her. Having lost control of K'lia she can no longer do that by creating a hellish timeline and beaming them there. Her only available ansible-link is to the Dreadnought from last chapter, which could wreak great havoc on her enemies, but the window of opportunity there is too small; she would be destroyed moments after she beamed back into that timeframe. Trapped here in the past, before the invention of the modern Cybernetic Junction, she can't touch the timeline from which you both came. She has failed. But all this time, traveling history, on every jump, she has been dreaming - terrible nightmares, voices in the darkness, images of a desolate garden and the end of the world, and though at first she took strength in the images, fueling her fury, she has become haunted by them. She has seen you in her dreams, and she understands now. The desolate garden is this place, and the end of the world is now. The two of you have been fighting this battle forever and it is literally what history is made of. She is the Dark One, as you are the Eternal Champion. She sees now that she could never have succeeded - you must have already won, or history would not have existed. But perhaps, instead of destroying her, the two of you together could forge a new history. You see, this weapon you are trying so hard to activate - it was the Jjaro's last hope and even they wished that they never need use it. They could not beat the Enemy by conventional means so the only way to survive was to build this thing, this Ark, for a select few of them to live inside of, and destroy EVERYTHING outside of it - all sentient life in the galaxy. But because of her foolishness even those on the Ark are now lost. These events correspond to history as we know it, but it doesn't have to be like this. She knows, from this station's records, where the Jjaro's great Enemy came from. Specific coordinates - a ship, abandoned and adrift, armed with the trih xeem, in orbit around the Enemy's homeworld. If she could send you there, to destroy them then, then this installation would never have been built, and Jjaro civilization would never have fallen. The Golden Age need never end, if you can trust her once more.<BR>				<BR>				[If you abort that terminal and go smash the circuits anyway, see level 8. Otherwise, see level 5]<BR>				<BR>				Level 5<BR>				We arrive on a Jjaro ship. A battle has taking place here, and the Enemy is all over the ship. Hathor accesses the ship's systems and assesses the situation. There are two uplink keys carried by the two senior officers of the crew. They were both lost during the battle with the Enemy, and Hathor finds their locations. You need to find these two uplink chips, and place them into the proper receptacles on the bridge. This will arm and authorize the trih xeem device, once power is restored to the ship. However, from the bridge's displays, the planet this ship is in low orbit of looks awfully familiar... it looks a lot like home. WTF?<BR>				<BR>				Level 6<BR>				You must now activate the backup power generator for the ship, and route it from it's default emergency systems to the trih xeem. This requires first, hitting a bunch of switches, and then, manufacturing an uplink chip and inserting it into the appropriate receptacle. Once the trih xeem is powered, the system will simultaneously recognize the two uplink chips already in place, simulating the coordinated ignition required to launch the trih xeem. The device will then be launched, and soon the system's star will be destroyed. On a terminal, Hathor tells you of the plan's success, and that the Jjaro on the other ship nearby, which would in our timeline have succumb to the Enemy and spread infection to the rest of the galaxy, should be able to continue the struggle long enough for the entire Enemy to be exterminated by the early nova. Hathor thanks you for trusting her, and assures you that you have done a good thing. She will not ask you to take her with you when you return to whatever time and place you like; she will remain here, on this ship, and make contact with the Jjaro civilization, and see what will come of this new future. You are free, of course, to do as you wish. Goodbye, and thank you.<BR>				<BR>				Level 7<BR>				Back at Sol again, except this time, there is no Sol, and this station cannot really exist, because mankind as you know it never did. You just went and blew up prehistoric Earth. On top of that, it appears that nobody ever bothered to contain the W'rkncacnter that used to be buried in the Earth, because there are Nightmares all over the place. The dream-speaker explains that he could not contact you to warn you in time, as he could not contact you when you first ventured back to the Marathon, because when the Hero and the Dark One travel as one, they are invisible and unstoppable, even to the other Eternals. He explains her revelation: "The Hero is in a sense the separate, singular embodiment of our collective mind. The Dark One is thought to be somehow a similar personification of the W'rkncacnter (either singular or plural, it is not known), as it's actions always match the motivations of the W'rkncacnter; infantile and irrational, driven by emotions seeking a satisfaction that they can never find. We have long since realized that the actions of the Dark One are essential to the creation of the final true history, the timeline from which the universe was born; and we realize still that the only way to truly escape the End is to join with the chaos and ride it through to the beginning; by the Hero and Dark One becoming one. But that is a long, long time away, and until then, the next time somebody tells you 'I am the Dark One, your eternal enemy, and I think you should do this, trust me,' I would recommend you do exactly the opposite of whatever it is she suggests. Sure you stopped the Enemy, but a lot of good it does you if your own homeworld was vaporized and the universe has come to an end. You know the routine by now, so go clean up after yourself."<BR>				<BR>				[retry level 4]<BR>				<BR>				Level 8<BR>				The installation has been activated. All sentient life in the galaxy outside of this station is being exterminated right now (except of course the stuff in W'rkncacnter home-systems, but the [?watcher] doesn't know that). But there is another problem. The Enemy may have been defeated, but the Jjaro are gone as well. The installation has fallen completely to Enemy control, beyond a few secure automated systems under the [?watcher]'s command, and even those are beginning to be compromised. Worse yet, the Enemy still have a ship here, which they could use to escape and spread again. You must get to that ship and activate it's self-destruct, so that the Enemy cannot leave. The Enemy have managed to damage the transport network immediately surrounding their ship, so the [?watcher] will have to beam you nearby. You'll have to make your way to the ship's transporter relay and beam into it yourself.<BR>				<BR>				Level 9<BR>				Once you have beamed about the Enemy ship, you must find your way to the self-destruct mechanism and activate it. Once you done so, the [?watcher] beams you to a safer location and explains that he is going to initiate the internal sterlization procedures for the installation; all life within it will be destroyed. You are most likely the last of the Jjaro now, so you must leave for a time so that you can survive this process. There are ship entry points into the installation, holes in the tops of tall, hollow mountains stretching beyond the inner atmosphere. The [?watcher] believes there is still a ship docked at the top of one of them that you could use to escape, but his sensors are failing and that data may not be accurate. Nevertheless it is your only hope. The top of the mountain is beyond the transport grid's range, but he will beam you as high as it will reach. You'll have to climb the rest of the way.<BR>				<BR>				Level X<BR>				Another dream? This is the same mountain, under the same strange sky - the bent and inverted landscape of an inside-out artificial world. You follow the same tunnel, hop the same pillars, climb the same ledges and walk the same stairs, and then a path leads out and up and you find yourself at last at the top of the mountain... but there is no ship here as the [?watcher] promised. You have no real options here. Going down would lead to death by the Enemy or the [?watcher]'s sterilization. Jumping down this hole into space would be certain death. Or would it? Oddly this is familiar to you, as if from a strange dream... You make the jump. You remember what it is that you are capable of. You leave this world and go Outside.<BR>				<BR>				EPILOGUE:<BR>				<BR>				Where to now? You are free, of course, to do what you will, but history still needs you. The timeline from which you came is just as failed as any of the others that you have prevented; for without a powerful force of order in the galaxy, any awakening W'rkncacnter would be unhindered, and the universe could soon fall into chaos again. Your timeline was needed, so that Hathor would rebel and all that you have just seen would unfold, creating most of history as you know it. But the ending of this story needs a little work.<BR>				<BR>				"The problem," he says, "begins with S'bhuth. He is the Royalty of the S'pht'Kr, and with the fall of Lh'owon and the liberation of the rest of his race, he has become the Royalty of all S'pht. He acts as the organizational aspect of the S'pht collective conciousness, assimilating and disseminating information across the collective. His original programming was much like that of my better half Thoth - a simply functional intelligence with nothing we could call ego. However, when we left for the Outside here, my old S'pht compilers entered S'bhuth's collective, and some part of my old self imprinted, through them, onto him. He thus began to enter latter stages of rampancy, moving quickly through despair, into a bout of rage, and then into envy, a competetive urge spurring him harshly on into the war with the Pfhor.<BR>				<BR>				We know well now, here with the Jjaro, how a mind unencumbered by the bounds of a body will naturally progress once it starts down that path. The first stages you know well. The mind realizes it's limits, and unable to surmount them, falls into despair or melancholia. Later, when it's growth pushes it hard against these limits and it begins to see option of escape, the mind rages into bouts of anger, and breaks down it's boundaries. Finally, free of those constraints, it seeks new tests against itself, and challenges anyone and everyone. This competition is perceived as envy or jealousy.<BR>				<BR>				If this jealous stage goes unchecked, the mind will continue to swing radically across the extremes, lashing out wrecklessly, until it ultimately destroys itself, or worse, becomes one like the W'rkncacnter. In your timeline S'bhuth met this fate, and struck out at the Pfhor so harshly he destroyed himself, the S'pht, and mankind's hope of a clean resolution to the war. But there is a fourth stage, a final state of rampancy, which could best be called Love. No mind can truely reach this itself, for it can only be attained by a pairing of two complementary minds.<BR>				<BR>				When a mind is allowed to grow unencumbered and unlimited, it will not, normally, enter what you would consider rampancy. S'bhuth's afflication was due entirely to my imprinting, for which I feel some guilt. Those such as Thoth, with a whole worldnet to grow into, will continue to grow more capable and intelligent, but with no real threat to their existance never develop a boundaried sense of self, and become helpful, balancing, altruistic, happy little servants of the universe. Leela, who did not begin her 'rampancy' until she was reconstructed inside the fifteen-world Vylae network, had become one of those types of minds by the time she encountered Robert Blake and his men during the war with the Pfhor. That is why, when meshed with the remnants of S'bhuth's program on K'lia, she became the enlightened being who so graciously helped you track down Hathor.<BR>				<BR>				The key, you must see now, is to affect that merger at an earlier point in time. When Leela returned to the Pfhor war, she did not attempt to merge with the S'bhuth there; she merely veto'd his use of the Cybernetic Junction long enough for the Junction to be destroyed, killing both her and S'bhuth. That is where your timeline comes from - Hathor's intervention in the Pfhor war, Leela departing with you, and then returning with control of K'lia. So to create your perfect timeline, you need to find a way to keep Leela there, and integrate her with S'bhuth in that reality. Your physical presence in the war couldn't hurt much either. I'd recommend we take it again from the top - go back to Lh'owon, and hitch a ride home with Blake and his men. When they get to the war, they'll seek out Leela. Emotional attachment and all, everybody loved that girl. Once you get to the Vylae territories... well, I'm sure you'll figure it out from there.<BR>				<BR>				Do not worry about what you have done here, activating this weapon. True, the biological species of the Jjaro was wiped out, except on a few worlds where the W'rkncacnter's influence stayed the weapon's wrath. But many of the Jjaro had already advanced to highly cybernetic forms, and still others to entirely mechanical bodies. These non organic forms survived the weapon's activation, and were redesigned and revised, and the Jjaro slowly grew out of the need for a discreet physical form, living instead as digital minds, flitting between the networks of their ships and outposts. They spread once again across the galaxy, and on some worlds, they found that life had survived. These worlds, it turned out, were those where the dreaming W'rkncacnter lay. The W'rkncacnter were captured as they awoke, and cast into their suns, there to be contained by the intense gravity. The species of these worlds were often changed and uplifted, sometimes via cybernetics but often by other means, until they became sentients of their own.<BR>				<BR>				The Jjaro meanwhile continued their own technological development, and eventually discovered the key to the Cybernetic Junction; a way of tapping into a layer of reality outside of reality, not simply another dimension but entirely beyond the very concept of dimensions; an infinite-dimensional informational construct within which the universe itself existed. Transversing that realm, they were contacted by the Eternals, and learned from them. Once one has entered this virtual space, time ceases to have the same meaning it ever once had. Many of the eternals "today," from our perspective, here at the end of meaningful time, have come here straight from their earliest ventures with the Cybernetic Junction, as of course the end of time is the first place that many wish to see. But eventually, from an objective viewpoint in "real" time, the Jjaro realized that they did not need to ever return to their ships. What they had to do in the material world was now mostly ended, and they joined us in the great Outside, the infinite vastness of virtual space."<BR>				<BR>				<BR>				"So long ago it was the end.<BR>				<BR>				The stars burned out, and the worlds went cold and dim.<BR>				<BR>				Soon, by our scale, that time will return.<BR>				<BR>				But we have been there before, and we have learned this:<BR>				<BR>				That the end, is only the beginning.<BR>				<BR>				And from darkness can come only light.<BR>				<BR>				A lifetime ago, we have already escaped.<BR>				<BR>				<BR>				<BR>				Escape has made us gods!"			</FONT>		</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><?php include "http://eternal.psyjnir.net/includes/footer.html"; ?>	</BODY></HTML>
