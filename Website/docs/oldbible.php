The skeletal structure, muscle fibres, and all tissues of the body are infused with tiny nanotubes of this incredibly strong molecule, and the original nanites which built this infrastructure remain in the body to continually repair any damage and generally keep the biological host in peak physical performance. The net result is that the host body is stronger and more durable than humanly possible, and will heal at a remarkable speed given the nanites are provided with enough energy to repair the damage done.<BR>				<BR>				Beyond these unseen structures, the Mark V contains a dispersed internal battery system, designed for wireless interface with all human, S'pht, Pfhor, and Jjaro charger systems. This battery powers both the repair nanites, as well as an energy dissipation shield in the Mark V's symbiotic battlesuit, which scatters the energy of everything within a few inches of the skin outward away from the host, in degrees proportional to the energy level encountered, protecting the host from the extremes of heat, light, and impact, without having to insulate him in a "force bubble".<BR>				<BR>				The Mark V is also equipped with cybernetic neural implants, centered on the Jjaro Cybernetic Junction, allowing storage of vast amounts of internal information, and a network of wired (non-chemical) nervous relays for extremely fast reflexes. An onboard digital adjunct program handles automatic translation of foreign languages, both spoken and written, and provides "intuitive reflexes" on the operation of new machines and electronic systems.<BR>				<BR>				The symbiotic battlesuit is equipped with an onboard pattern buffer and replicator, allowing the Mark V to carry equipment far beyond the normal point of encumberance, even for a person of his strength. This inventory can be put away or retrieved via an internal visual interface in the battlesuit helmet, controlled hands-free via the cybernetic link with the host. To support the vast amounts of data needed to store this inventory's pattern structure, the Mark V battlesuit helmet contains a vast data storage center that greatly augments the information carrying capacity of the host. This helmet is also capable of wirelessly interfacing over short distances with a variety of computer systems. The digital adjunct program will attempt to translate and decipher any protocols as neccesary.				<BR>				<BR>				THE CYBERNETIC JUNCTION<BR>				<BR>				The Jjaro Cybernetic Junction is a twofold device. Firstly and most obviously, as Human scientists perceived it, it is a sort of quantum computer, a device which will store an exceedingly large, perhaps even infinite amount of data, and process it at effectively instantaneous speeds. It seems to possess a level of internal artificial intelligence which is simultaneously rudimentary in function and extremely advanced in form; what it does is somehow assess what information systems it has been affixed to, assimilate that network and all it's data, and determine where the boundaries of it's "self" are. In this sense it was used by Human scientists as a sort of "surrogate soul", reviving the neural function of dead soldiers whose bodies had otherwise been repaired to a functional level.<BR>				<BR>				The true function of the Cybernetic Junction is far more powerful. It is effectively an access point to "the Outside", an informational level of reality more fundamental than the one on which any physics run on. It was designed by the digital Jjaro to serve both as an informational device, storing unlimited amounts of data from it's connected network and processing it instantly, as well as a communications and transportation device. As such, it is also designed to transmit standard subspace communications through the Outside, and it also functions as a transporter programmed to take the assessed "self" through the Outside to another location in reality.<BR>				<BR>				These latter functions require that the host network understand how to access them; the informational capacity is automatically functional as described above via a very advanced form of "plug and play". Note that the information of the host network assimilates in part into the infinite dataspace of the Cybernetic Junction. It effectively becomes "long, long term memory", where the most core and often-used information is stored. In this sense it truely becomes the "soul" of the host network, and any new host will inherit that core data from the previous.<BR>				<BR>				When a Cybernetic Junction establishes a subspace communications channel through the Outside, this is called an "ansible". An ansible link will remain open until it is closed from the host network, and only one ansible link may be open at at time. This affects the function of AIs attempting to use the Junction as a means of remotely accessing other systems (as opposed to transporting their own home network), because if another program gains access to the home network and closes the ansible link, the first program will be unable to contact the home network and reestablish the ansible to get back.<BR>				<BR>				Lastly, control of the Cybernetic Junction is multi-user and open by default. A Junction will accept any commands received via subspace so long as the host network has not prohibited them. An intelligent program using a Cybernetic Junction to go "out of body" to other systems will want to leave a few processes behind to guard the functions of the Cybernetic Junction to make sure that no other programs gain unauthorized access while the first program is away.<BR>				<BR>				<BR>				THE HISTORY OF THE ETERNALS<BR>				<BR>				At the dawn of time, there was the Big Bang. Shortly thereafter, as energy cooled and matter began to condense, what the S'pht call W'rkncacnter appeared from Outside. These were physical beings, neither truely organic or mechanical but some leviathonesque hybrid on the most fundamental level. They were the furthest evolution of biology and technology merged of various alien races from distant galaxies in the far in the future. They were all sociologically savage races, warlike and domineering, despite the advances of technology they had managed to reach. As their technology had progressed and their needs became intrinsically met or even nonexistant, they lost any rational reason for conflict; but millenia of warfare for these many now-immortal beings had bred them now to beings of pure hate and malice, driven by emotions that could never be satisfied.<BR>				<BR>				They came back to this primordial time after the discovery of the Outside, to war with one another over the future of the universe, and using their innate weapons which could alter the very fabric of reality at the weilder's wish, had shortly come as close to exterminating each other as possible. When the wars had ended, the W'rkncacnter drifted through space, and as stars, galaxies, and planets formed, the dormant W'rkncacnter came to rest on various planets around the universe, or were trapped by the gravity of stars or black holes.<BR>				<BR>				As the W'rkncacnter began to awake, they began to dream, and their dreams, tied in as they were to their innate reality-altering abilities, influenced the worlds around them. The W'rkncacnter had seen, in their travels throughout space and time, the many types of creature that would come to be in the world, and so they dreamt of the future and in doing so, began to shape it. On the worlds where W'rkncacnter dreamt, sentient life arose, and from those worlds it began to spread.<BR>				<BR>				On the planet Earth, one such race arose, forerunners of modern humans, and calling themselves Jjaro, they developed advanced technologies and left Earth to colonize the galaxy. As the life of homeworld had been threatened several times in the advancement of their civilization, once they found other worlds to live upon, they made the Earth into a garden paradise.<BR>				<BR>				But eventually the W'rkncacnter on Earth began to stir, and it dreamt into being a horrible parasitic foe that the Jjaro called simply the Enemy. The Enemy spead all across the Jjaro on Earth, and by the time they had realized the source and discovered a way to sedate the awakening W'rkncacnter, cleansing much of the Earth of those who had not yet found hosts, the Enemy had infected the crews of two of the Jjaro's most powerful ships, and from there began to spread into the rest of Jjaro civilization. By the time a proper countermeasure could be mounted against them, they had already gained enough power to post an imminant threat to Jjaro civilization. Any ship boarded by the Enemy was inevitably captured and added to their forces.<BR>				<BR>				And so finally, the Jjaro conceived of a final solution. A fortress world was built, which emitted a series of energy pulses that together would wipe out all higher life in the galaxy, destroying any possible Enemy hosts. It was not suicide, however - the Jjaro were already a highly cybernetic race, and many of them had already become entirely cybernetic beings, either robotic humanoid form, or merely software programs running through the networks of their starships. Those Jjaro survived, and spread about the galaxy seeking any life which had survived.<BR>				<BR>				They found such life, ironically, on all the worlds known (then or later) to contain dormant W'rkncacnter. It seems the reality-altering effects innate to them had protected those worlds from the Jjaro's final weapon, and thus life on some worlds did survive, even while Jjaro civilization collapsed. The surviving Jjaro sought to uplift the non-Jjaro species of these various worlds, to bring more sentients into the universe and rebuild another civilization.<BR>				<BR>				These direct efforts were short-lived, however, for the still-advancing Jjaro discovered the Outside via the invention of the Cybernetic Junction, and shortly thereafter most of them left the material world for the Outside. There they joined with other races, and their own kind from different times and timelines - all of those which had discovered the Outside anywhere in the multiverse. Collectively, these are called the Eternals.<BR>				<BR>				Many of these were peaceful and enlightened beings, and became more so by the omniscience and true immortality which existance Outside provided. But some of these beings were primitive and simple minds that should not be playing with such powerful technology. The Jjaro - as we shall for convenience call all the enlightened Eternals - made in all such cases an attempt to communicate and enlighten those lost souls. But in some cases, such as the W'rkncacnter, persuasion simply was not possible.<BR>				<BR>				It is not an important matter that the W'rkncacnter would not listen to the Jjaro, for from Outside, changes to history are irrelevent, because the original history still exists. The Jjaro's goal, then, as a collective group, is simply to ensure that there exists a timeline of optimal good, one in which the W'rkncacnter may be contained until the End of time, when events cycle back upon themselves to the very Beginning and for a moment, all are one. At that moment, the Jjaro must somehow merge with the W'rkncacnter and beam them forward in time a moment, to ensure that that single, pivotal moment from which all of history is determined, is not ruled by the whim of a W'rkncacnter.<BR>				<BR>				To this end, the Jjaro create in particular instances a Hero, a singular personification of their collective will, in mortal form, linked to them by a Cybernetic Junction. There seems to exists for every such instance of the Hero an Enemy, presumed to be some similar incarnation of a (singular) or the (plural) W'rkncacnter, which opposes the Hero at every junction. It is ironic that the actions of the Enemy often play directly into the history sought to be created by the Jjaro via the Hero; in that sense all of history can be thought of as a dance between the Jjaro and W'rkncacnter.<BR>				<BR>				<BR>				UNTOUCHED CONCEPTS<BR>				<BR>				There are a couple of concepts that I wanted to touch on in the Eternal story but couldn't find any real way to do so. They may make suitable material for a sequel or perhaps another chapter or two in the middle of Eternal. (I miss having seven chapters. It just felt so... right). Unfortunately all of them would require the creation of new monsters.<BR>				<BR>				One of them is the further inner parts of Pfhor society, specifically the Pfhor religion, the "Holy Mother crouched behind the throne", and the "hindmost creche". A creche is a nursury, and thus I have always figured that the "Holy Mother crouched behind the throne" is some sort of Pfhor Queen, in the insect-hive sense of the word. The Pfhor religion would thus be as pathetically boring as parent worship - she created them all and is thus their goddess, blah blah. What the significance of killing her would be, I'm not entirely sure, but it certainly wouldn't be GOOD for the Pfhor's war efforts.<BR>				<BR>				Another concept I wanted to work in is the Vylae and Leela's involvement there, and how to reconcile the fact that the M2 epiligue says they could never purge Leela from their network with the fact that Leela has left the Vylae network on a captured Pfhor ship with some human survivors of some battle or another. In Eternal I fudge it a little... see, the Vylae didn't PURGE her, she just LEFT. But it would be nice if she could still somehow stay there while leaving, without copies of Leela lying all around. It seems possible, seeing how the Vylae apparently have a network that spans 15 worlds, that she could somehow extend the network to wherever she goes.<BR>				<BR>				The last of the concepts is that of the Nar. Rob McLees has written a lot about the Nar outside of the Marathon games, and I believe his word can be taken as canon on such issues. One of the more curious dichotomies about the Nar seems to be that they are extremely low-tech, with "coal powered battle wagons", but have been in existance since a week after the universe began. The only way I can think to explain this is that they are a rather primitive, backwards race, without enough intelligence to actually evolve their own culture, who somehow came into possession of enough technology to be a spacefaring race that could rob a Pfhor ship... who then somehow wound up back in time a week after the Big Bang. While scientifically speaking it is a far stretch, it's not unheard of in science fiction (I can recall one Star Trek TNG episode which featured a largely unintelligent race who tricked and stole their way into a variety of technology). The Nar ARE described in the M2 epilogue as privateers (at least some of them), so it would fit too.<BR>				<BR>				These three concepts all fit together rather nicely, for inner Pfhor society obviously has a lot to do with the Pfhor War; Leela escapes from the Vylae network during the Pfhor war; and the Nar have trade relations with the Vylae as evidenced by the M2 epilogue, so they could easily become involved too. Seeing how at the end of Eternal, Marcus is going back to Lh'owon to hitch a ride with Robert Blake head on into the Pfhor wars, therein hopefully to marry Leela to S'bhuth in a proper way to prevent the catastrophic timeline that Eternal comes from, I think this would make excellent sequel material. Blake and his men, with Marcus, wind up in the Vylae system looking for Leela; with their help Leela escapes and makes her way back to help fight the war. Somewhere along the war the Nar are encountered and they become involved as well. In the end, Leela merged with S'bhuth; the Pfhor Queen is killed and the Pfhor are defeated; and somehow or another, the Nar wind up back in time. Perhaps Robnar's prophecies relate to all of this somehow.<BR>				<BR>				<BR>			</FONT>		</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><?php include "http://eternal.psyjnir.net/includes/footer.html"; ?>	</BODY></HTML>
