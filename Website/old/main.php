The sequel, Marathon 2: Durandal, was released in				1995, improving on the engine technologies and greatly expanding the scope of the series. In				1996, Marathon 2 was ported to Windows 95, and the Marathon Infinity package was released,				including a new scenario using a modified Marathon 2 engine, and most importantly, the tools				used to build it, Forge and Anvil. In the year 2000, Bungie released the source code to the				Marathon 2 engine, and the Marathon Open Source project began, resulting in the new Marathon				engine called Aleph One. Finally, in 2005, Bungie authorized free redistribution of the				entire Marathon trilogy and all related files. This means that the entire trilogy can now be				legally obtained for free and played on nearly any computer.</p>			</div>				<div class="sub" id="dev">				<h2>Found a problem? Think something could be better?</h2>									<p>Forrest Cameranesi here, lead designer for Eternal.</p>								<p>The last version of Eternal publicly released was still in a very "1.0" state, and I'm not incredibly				proud of that. There's a lot more polish that could be done to it, and numerous other prominent figures				in the Marathon development community, such as Crater Creator of <em>Excalibur: Morgana's Revenge</em>				and RyokoTK of <em>Phoenix</em>, have written extensive reviews outlining some of these points, which I				planned to use as to-do lists for future revisions (see their reviews				<a href="http://www.pfhorums.com/index.php?showtopic=3518">here</a>				and <a href="http://www.pfhorums.com/index.php?showtopic=5570">here</a>).</p>				<p>Beyond that, a number of things were cut to get a playable 1.0 out the door, and these were				planned to be incorporated into a truly final version to be called "Eternal X Omega".				Among those cut features were new high-res renders of all the weapons, players, and Bobs,				a handful of multiplayer maps (at least one in each environment), and a five-level cooperative				"Vidmaster's Challenge" of sorts.</p>								<p>Along the way, some changes to the middle of the story occurred, and a couple levels got				shuffled around or replaced in the process. Because of this, I planned to release a version 1.1				incorporating those changes and the other improvements thus far. That got through three betas, but				then career, relationships, and life in general sapped any semblance of time or energy to				keep working on this project from me. And I've since moved to a newer computer and don't even have				access to the old familiar toolchain I used to do development with.</p>								<p>But I feel bad letting this project languish, especially as I see people are still downloading,				playing, and talking about it to this day. So I'm calling for help from any fans of this project				with skills to lend, to maybe help carry it over the threshold into something a little more polished.				I don't have high hopes or aspirations for implementing new multiplayer or cooperative levels,				but I have a full set of mostly completed Cinema4D weapon models awaiting rendering and a nifty new				floating HUD awaiting those weapon graphics that I'd really like to get out the door somehow, plus all				the minor tweaks and improvements suggested in the reviews above. And of course, the whole project				needs to be brought over to the new modern Marathon development toolchain, and packaged as a proper				Aleph One stand-alone scenario.</p>								<p>So if you'd like to help this project really shine, drop me a line at				<a href="mailto:forrest@bungie.org">forrest@bungie.org</a> and lets see if we can't set something up.</p>								<ul>			</div>		</div>		<div class="banner" id="footer">			<img src="/images/footer.png" alt="Please send questions, comments, praise, errors, bug reports, complains, job offers, and money to eternal@bungie.org.
