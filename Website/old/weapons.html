This, combined with an automated reloading mechanism capable of interfacing 						directly with an officer's portable pattern buffer systems, can enable skilled officers to dual-wield						the Cronus-class, providing highly effective plasma fire coverage in intense combat situations.						<BR>					</TD>				</TR></TABLE>			</FONT>		</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR>		<TR><TD ALIGN="center"><HR WIDTH="100%"></TD></TR>		<TR><TD ALIGN="center"><TABLE WIDTH="100%"><TR><TD VALIGN>			<FONT FACE="Bank Gothic Lt BT, Arial, Helvetica, Sans Serif">				<TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="25"><TR>					<TD VALIGN="center" WIDTH="33%">						<TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="25" CELLSPACING="0"><TR><TD VALIGN="center">							<IMG SRC="images/weapons/fusion_cannon.png">						</TD></TR></TABLE>					</TD>					<TD VALIGN="top" WIDTH="84%">						<B>Ouranus-class Fusion Cannon</B><BR>						<BR>						Designed specifically as an anti-armor weapon in the war with the Pfhor, the Ouranus-class Fusion Cannon						is a high powered iteration of Cronus-class technology. With a much higher rate of fire and						an elongated barrel for improved control, the Ouranus-class can provide more effective						plasma fire coverage than even two Cronus-class Fusion Pistols. It also retains the secondary overload-fire						feature from the older Zeus-class model, enabling an officer to charge a more powerful shot before discharging						the weapon.
