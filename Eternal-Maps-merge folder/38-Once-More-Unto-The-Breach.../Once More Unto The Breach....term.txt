Work with the Drinniol to exterminate the Pfhor in this part of the ship. Find any terminal when you are finished and I will take us out. Good luck.

Excellent work. Our next objective is to secure the command deck and hand control of the ship over to the Drinniol.

The self-destruct sequence on the Jjaro Dreadnought has gone off without a hitch, and it is now safely out of the Pfhor's hands. They would likely just have destroyed it anyway, given the troubles that Jjaro technology has caused them today. But it's better to be safe.

I will now beam you up to the ship's command deck. Find a terminal when you arrive and I'll give you further instructions.

Prepare for transport.
