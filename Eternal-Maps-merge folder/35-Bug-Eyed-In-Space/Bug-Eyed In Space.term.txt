Work with the Drinniol to exterminate the Pfhor in this part of the ship. Find any terminal when you are finished and I will take us out. Good luck.

Excellent work. Our next objective is to secure the command deck, and hand control of the ship over to.... just a moment...

The Jjaro Dreadnought's self-destruct has been deactivated, and the ship's engines and weapon systems are powering up.

....no. She couldn't...

We have to go, now.
